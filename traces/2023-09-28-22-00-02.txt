49. is there any research on the dynamics of fabric in a shirt as people move?
50. ChatGPT
51. Used ScholarAI
52. I found several research papers that discuss the dynamics of fabric in relation to human movement and other aspects. Here are summaries of a few relevant ones:

54. Fit and Pressure Comfort Evaluation on a Virtual Prototype of a Tight-Fit Cycling Shirt by Yetanawork Teyeme, B. Malengier, T. Tesfaye, S. Vasile, L. Van Langenhove
55. 
56. This study aimed to improve garment pattern design to provide support and enhance comfort to the user, focusing on a tight-fit cycling shirt. The study used 3D fashion design software CLO 3D and pressure mapping to achieve the required graduated compression while ensuring fit and comfort. The impact of fabric types on garment fit was analyzed, and the study found that visualized pressure on the human body model shows distributions related to contact between body and garment, affecting garment wear comfort and freedom of movement.

58. Learning to Fold Real Garments with One Arm: A Case Study in Cloud-Based Robotics Research by Ryan Hoque, K. Shivakumar, Shrey Aeron, Gabriel Deza, Aditya Ganapathi, Adrian S. Wong, Johnny Lee, Andy Zeng, Vincent Vanhoucke, Ken Goldberg
59. 
60. This paper presents the first systematic benchmarking of fabric manipulation algorithms on physical hardware using a cloud robotics platform. The study developed learning-based algorithms that model expert actions, keypoints, reward functions, and dynamic motions for folding a crumpled T-shirt with a single robot arm. Results suggest a new algorithm combining imitation learning with analytic methods achieves human-level performance on the flattening task and 93% of human-level performance on the folding task.
