4. 
5. there's been a lot of time between right now and when this script first launched!
6. 
7. it's ok, i can fix this. we're still chilling
8. 
9. the time was productive anyways
10. 
11. alright cool imma continue talking about ME in my college essays now
12. i don't really want to become a bum that does nothing but college essays, but doing productive things other than that can be difficult
13. though, doing colleges essays- is it really that productive? considering that making things or doing research or developing the team would bring more actual results, this one is just capping my ass off about what i've done
14. 
15. which doesn't bring actual results, and chatgpt could do that. though chatgpt doesn't like to cap, and it doesn't produce high quality work
16. but there's no real results either way. it's like reactive power, but worse cuz that's imaginary, just a figment of my mind
