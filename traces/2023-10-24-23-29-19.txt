1. i might not even get deferred
2. that's not good
3. 
4. we'll try anyways
5. 
6. let's see... physics... please see my latex rendering for some context
7. i believe it's very hard to do anything in physics early
8. 
9. i'm constructing something centered around common sense.. i don't need people to tell me how to get feedback, because this is an optimal system
10. the journals.i don't need people telling me how well i run a team, i need to tell them how badly
11. 
12. i'm not sure what your plan was for the research paper for early admissions. you had like two weeks
13. you barely understand differential geometry anyways
