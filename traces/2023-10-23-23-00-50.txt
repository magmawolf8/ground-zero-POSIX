1. i think that philosophy is kind of dumb when it comes to thanatophobia
2. like chill out, just be absurd
3. 
4. i feel like i've been considering absurdism for a while, it just hasn't come to mind that HCSSiM's caused me to do that
5. because of absurdity of that claim
6. also, i need problem solving. it's good taht philosophy has come to me so late, but how many blocks deep is this? and how much experience with problem solving have i gotten already, sepcially from my journals, such that thanatophobia doesn't even bother me that much anymore?
