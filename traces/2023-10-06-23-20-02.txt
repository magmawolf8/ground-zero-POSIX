1. is that part bold?
2. i can't tell
3. 
4. i forgot your name again
5. so many things to track, but i'll think of it again. i'll list the important shit here
6. 
7. 
8. there are so many things wrong with this neural network visualization of a thing like the precise deterministic math
9. but it's interesting, but there are so many bad edge cases like random things appearing like houses, and bad pov changes, though the second one's less worrisome
10. 
11. in general, we don't want to do that. lemme explain something else
12. 
13. and i forgot physics again.
14. don't woryr, i can keep track, just over time to acclimate or optimize
15. adaptable everywhere, except over different parts of myself
16. and time.
17. that's super technical, but a satire of acedia isn't too hard
18. 
19. but we're slow. keeping track of time, we found issues
20. i think they're going here soon
21. 
22. 
23. i don't care if you nag me
24. i'm supposed to write them down? ABSOLUTELY NOT
25. we will have a civilized conversation, and digitize it separatley
26. 
27. i'm not sure if i'm off track or not, but for small things, i can draw from previous experience and patterns and deterministic themselves
28. for big things, like writing essays, i will have to try harder
