1. efficiency
2. planning for recs
3. and lastly, my own chatgpt for planning
4. 
5. and literary analysis of the provided texts!
6. like, i read this and was like "this text is fucked UP"
7. then, i got to considering why I thought it was fucked up
8. screwed up *
9. 
10. then, i could find the differences between the time "The merchant of Venice" was written and now
11. it's like finding the social differences
12. 
13. so, social science!
14. 
15. i like to stick to my argument, such that i'm ethical
16. 
17. also, things like literary analysis i kind of stray from
18. my analysis is all over the place but it gives a strong argument
19. i guess i can fight harder and escalate harder, the more controversial the argument is
20. 
21. because i'm ethical, in social sciences, as well as efficient
