There it is. A 4-foot-wide luminescent replica of the "all your base" meme, C.A.T.S. commander's coy expression staring out. "ALL YOUR LEDS ARE BELONG TO US," the glowing inscription read. Its creators, three members of FIRST Robotics Competition Team 9114, grinned sheepishly at me, knowing that those lights were supposed to go on the robot.

I've been doing robotics for eight years. But only recently have I realized my dreams for a truly student-led organization. In eleventh grade, I became the sole founder of FRC 9114 and devoted myself to covering "all your base" that belong to FRC 9114.

But my experience with this particular very-student-led team came with its own, unique mindset challenges. One such challenge was pride.



Thus, the "ALL YOUR LEDS" meme infuriated me because it hinted 

In a student-led team, common passion is much more important than common knowledge. But is that abstract information useful? How does it relate to dissidents, and my own sense of responsibility for the team in spite of many people's characterization of me that I'm supposed to be quiet and sniff solder fumes in the corner?

Basically, because it's student-led, and because I have this sense of responsibility that stems from my knowledge of soft skills, I found it much easier to suppress dissidents
