please create a text editor in tkinter with the following:

using this base class:
class TextEditor(tk.Frame):
    def __init__(self, parent, bg_color, fg_color, font=("Courier", 20), *args, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(parent, *args, **kwargs)

        self.configure(bg=bg_color)
        self.pack(side=tk.TOP, fill=tk.BOTH, expand=True)

        # Create the text box
        self.text_box = tk.Text(self, relief="flat", font=font, bg=bg_color, fg=fg_color, insertbackground=fg_color, highlightthickness=1, highlightbackground=fg_color)
        self.text_box.pack(expand=True, fill=tk.BOTH, padx=10, pady=10)

    def save(self, filename):
        # Save the content in another thread
        thread = Thread(target=self._save_content, args=(filename,))
        thread.start()

    def _save_content(self, filename):
        # Get the content of the text box
        content = self.text_box.get("1.0", tk.END)

        # Create the directory if it doesn't exist
        directory = '.traces'

        full = os.path.join(os.getcwd(), "traces", filename)

        # Write the content to the file
        with open(full, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as file:
            file.write(content)
        print("Content saved to:", full)






rather than the basic save, i'd like to create a temporary version control when using the editor to create new files.
first, in the text editor's init, create a git repository. also use gitpython
implementing rudimentary Git functionality in a Python application is definitely feasible and can be a great way to add version control features to the application. Here's a basic outline of how you could approach this:
This can be done by executing git init in the desired directory.

Commit Changes: Whenever the user makes a significant change or at certain intervals, commit these changes to the Git repository. This involves adding files to the staging area (git add) and then committing (git commit).

Branching and Checkout: If you want to support different branches for edits (like undo/redo trees), you can create new branches and checkout between them as needed.

Clean up: Once the user is done and finalizes their changes, you can optionally delete the repository or retain it, depending on the use case. If it's a temporary edit, cleaning up the repository might be a good idea to save space.

GUI Integration: If your application has a graphical user interface, you can integrate these Git functionalities into the GUI, allowing users to perform version control operations directly from the interface.

Error Handling: Ensure to add proper error handling for Git operations, as working with external systems (like a VCS) can often lead to unexpected issues.


























bruh we suck at generalizing color
at leastew e saved those observations
what is a ga- you know what it doesn't matter
because we can psectrometer each section and just figure out what it says
color is an illusion and irrelevant to faraway stars anyways, unless you're looking
just in general, not you, idon't care actually, just take it normally
