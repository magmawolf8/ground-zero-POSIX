how do I add git functionality to this?
i need to know how to visualize diagrams in git
I also need to know if commits can be done in memory, holy shit

At least the different saves here are in diffs. maybe, like that? but that would be even more compilacted.
also, when we destroy the window, we need to save everything, then destroy

how can I make my cursor wider, or at least brag more about it? how can I also make my cursor replace rather than insert? that would be an interesting paradigm- you can't exit replace mode

considering essay number one: how will I be able to delete that without sadness? are you just taking advantage of your own fears? i guess at some point replace mode will be easy, but in geeral we shoudl consider that it will be a pain in the ass to you. and that's good---you'll be afraid of . and i know i can make it with replace mode, because  I'll avoid replacing things? i can insert things still, but both I don't like. just conssisider it a little more.
