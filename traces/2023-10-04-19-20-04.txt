1. that's very kind of you to tell me this
2. 
3. 
4. 
5. bro i'm so stupid
6. what am i even doing
7. 
8. and we need address that sometime
9. not now
10. right now, we will train the dataset.
11. 
12. i guess i gotta use scripts to make it easier
13. 
14. though, adding this extra one won't make it any different
15. 
16. 
17. 
18. 
19. my brain is not thinking right now
20. that's a big problem
21. because i slept so late?? nah idk
22. 
23. 
24. i can't choke here
25. 
26. will we be ok together with this advice? this dream? bruh fuck the dream. a good college isn't cool. you know what's cool? circles! and a GREAT college. my own OCD sucks
27. 
28. was I considering research?
29. perhaps that was it. let me check the stack trace and previous essays.
30. i have barely use for previous, but the archive is good corpus
31. 
32. i tihnk you need to expand that idea. and consider the alternative that college isn't the be-all-end-all. it's just pretrain.
33. if i'm cool enough, I can just start a business and chill
34. but that's not cool. you know what's cool? going to space yourself. yeah, fuck this ambition
35. 
36. i kind of want to be a puppet. the pioneer, but i'm only partly manipulating my own things
37. 
38. 
39. did we get it? it might not have been research, looking from my traces. it's just as likely to be either in my view. but it's probably irrelevant. that's why my ambitions are are those. consider my point. puppetry? nah. business? nah. I want to lead a TEAM as a puppet, in the frontier
40. 
41. 
42. objects. are so weird. windows ls barely even works
43. 
44. it doesn't know what i need. but i'm just expanding the face
45. 
46. 
47. 
48. 
49. a bunch of neckbeards don't have reputation- stackexchange doesn't know what it's talking about
50. but without it, i'd have to use chatgpt for these big code files, and they haven't made a big enough model yet
51. we'll wait for now. and the model probably isn't trained on stackexchange stuff, it' sjust there
52. 
53. 
54. a self-aware dog?  a puppet has no thing to do with chatgpt
55. 
56. 
57. mobile chatgpt doesn't define title,s but i don't care anyways
58. what is define? it doesn't name?  i don't care how it works right now. it's not on the priority. I'm a puppet here, in space, ugh
59. trying to fix some robot that broke. when i should be in the labdoing more mars soil experiments
60. that's an interesting fiction
61. biophysics can't bet hat hard
62. 
63. that's a problem of the process. but i'm developing something completely different for which i'm making good pracitecs
64. no need in a dumbass script
65. in physics modeling though, we need to be transparent
66. though, there are'nt a whole lot of edge cases
67. just in data analysis, we need to make sure everyting is processed right.
68. but here it's just text
69. 
70. honestly i don't care about this at all. i'm a scientist i hope, not an engineer
71. 
72. 
73. 
74. it failed
75. 
76. 
77. i'm not manic, i'm just doing
78. i just don't want to lose five dollars, i'm aware, and though i'm a puppet, maybe my puppeteer is manic
79. i just don't want to lose to nikhil
80. 
81. 
82. what is nikhil even doing to me? a bet? lemme analyse. i'm not too good with engilsh itself, but sophistication doesn't need good english
83. i just need to soundl ike i know what i'm doing lol
84. i just don't want to do bad things. so i can analyse for parallels
