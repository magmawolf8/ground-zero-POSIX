1. 
2. don't think too hard about it. if you do, you kind of die
3. since they're gonna die too
4. 
5. this plot is so juicy
6. 
7. economically, there is no problem
8. but you feel bad? i get it
9. you forgot risk analysis
10. 
11. you could kill them? but you do not have a knife
12. 
13. and this person continues to procrastinate. and they kind of resemble me, but my different parts are so well isolated, the puppet isolates the soul from the senses, that it must be wholly different, and I should consider another approach , skew with this one. or intersecting? that's the word. I want to see if i can appeeal to them, without anything serious like what could happene
14. 
15. and this person does not have a full measure of himself. tsk tsk
16. never do that. life will pass you by
17. 
18. a puppet would never lose itself
19. 
20. yep, i'm searching for truth, and i got so many more tools to actively search after I got a full measure of myself
21. 
22. our options seem to be finite
23. lemme spell them out for you
24. 
25. 
26. there is something to be said about the composure here. my idea generation is too quick to write down, but it's ok because i can just lock onto the best option
27. 
28. and chill there
29. 
30. it's not so hard, i'm actually fairly stable even for a puppet
31. 
32. wow, this is kind of an interrogation 
33. 
34. 
35. 
36. 
37. that was a literal interrogation. the plot is really thick now, i think i need to graph it
38. 
39. or something, but this is very useful for writing
40. i analyzed part of it.
41. lets try to analyze the puppetry and its relationship to slomotion
42. 
43. man we really are in slow motion right now
