There it is. A 4-foot-wide luminescent replica of the "all your base" meme, C.A.T.S. commander's coy expression staring out. "ALL YOUR LEDS ARE BELONG TO US," the glowing inscription read. Its creators, three members of FIRST Robotics Competition Team 9114, grinned sheepishly at me, knowing that those lights were supposed to go on the robot.

I've been doing robotics for eight years. But only recently have I realized my dreams for a truly student-led organization. In eleventh grade, I became the sole founder of FRC 9114 and devoted myself to covering "all your base" that belong to FRC 9114.
