1. when we start, we use the introduction that's already been done, the meme is pretty good
2. facts about my starting the team... I might have some trouble with this one
	a. what facts do I want to add? basically, flaunting how good our outreach is
	b. perhaps I want to link the introduction to my desire for standardization?

3. The "ALL YOUR LEDS BELONG TO US" (potentially replace) infuriated me. It's not a big deal
	I can just take it apart---but when things become emotionally charged, it's my job to defuse emotions. What's the difference between a fight here and a typical fight in leadership? Well, I can probably try to connect whatever's here, to an analysis of something unique to me.

Jesus, take the wheel is an interesting song, because Jesus tells people to love, but when it comes to things like communication, people expect me to be quiet. but no! i wouldn't do that.

potentially, I can write something about my powerful emotion of try
