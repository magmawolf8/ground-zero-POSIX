1. i keep getting shoved to python
2. and this program doesn't constrain me anymore
3. 
4. anyways, stop being here for the sole purpose of showing off your mathematical knowledge!
5. i'm here because i want to learn things. then i will only flex my knowledge a little.--
6. 
7. if you know it already, there's no point in re-learning everything
8. thus this one is interesting.
9. i think i took the short end of the stick by doing chaos.
10. 
11. information theory would have been more interesting.
12. 
13. and provided more connections in the end!
14. 
15. well, there probably wasn't a big idfference. but then, there's the paradox that it's not so different, and couldn't have caused a difference, but thikning about it again we realize that it is actually a big ddeal
16. gimem that!
17. 
18. 
19. 
20. 
21. the first line actually says that "I keep getting shoved to the xkcd python when this starts, which is intentional, but"
22. is this even saving correctly?
23. 
24. i shouldn't be slowed by physical roadblocks :((((((((((((((((((((
25. yeah, i don't care how your knowledge originated with your strange name of strange attractors
26. just cuz that's strange doesn't mean you're allowed to be strange.
