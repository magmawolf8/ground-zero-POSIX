1630|4:30|At 4:30 Gunther came back to House Berg with his arms full of yellow daffodils. Frau Julia was Frau Julia again, and she received both him and the daffodils with open arms.
1630|4:30|The local police wouldn't relish being called out at 4:30 on Christmas Eve, and if this was some kind of hoax he preferred not to be an active participant.
1630|four-thirty|“I won’t go in,” she says. “I’ll meet you on the steps at four-thirty. We can take the girls to Murray’s for a sundae or something.”<br>He seems relieved. “Right,” he says.<br>“Tell the children to enjoy themselves.”
1630|Four thirty|Jonas rolls painfully out of the hammock, his aching lower back stiff and swollen, in desperate need of a chiropractor. He checks his watch. Four thirty…but is it a.m. or p.m.?
1630|four thirty p.m.|Sometimes I wonder what happened to the girl—the thought usually pops into my mind when I’m facing a steaming-hot plate of spaghetti. After she hung up, did she disappear forever, sucked into the four thirty p.m. shadows? Was I partly to blame? <br>I want you to understand my position, though. At the time, I didn’t want to get involved with anyone. That’s why I kept on cooking spaghetti, all by myself. In that huge pot, big enough to hold a German shepherd.
1630|four-thirty|At four-thirty I dash out of the hotel, resolved to make a last-minute stab at it. Just as I turn the corner I brush against Walter Pach. Since he doesn’t recognize me, and since I have nothing to say to him, I make no attempt to arrest him. Later, when I am stretching my legs in the Tuileries his figure reverts to mind.
1630|four-thirty|A server is woken at hour four-thirty by stimulin in the airflow, then yellow-up in our dormroom. After a minute in the hygiener and steamer, we put on fresh uniforms before filing into the restaurant.
1630|four-thirty|This afternoon everything is matching up. When the swing shift comes on duty the clock says four-thirty, just like it should.
1630|half-past four|I looked at the clock. It was half-past four. “Had no idea what hour it was,” Brett said. “I say, can a chap sit down? Don’t be cross, darling. Just left the count. He brought me here.”
1630|four-thirty|At four-thirty that afternoon in late January when I stepped into the parlour with Boo, my dog, Hutch was in his favourite armchair, scowling at the television, which he had muted.
1630|four thirty|I leave the office at four thirty, head up to Xclusive where I work out on free weights for an hour, then taxi across the park to Gio's in the Pierre Room for a facial, a manicure and, if time permits, a pedicure.
1630|four-thirty|She hung up on me at first, then asked me whether I made a point of behaving like a 'small-time suburban punk' with women I had slept with. But after apologies, insults, laughter, and tears, Romeo and Juliet were to be seen together later that afternoon, mushily holding hands in the dark at a four-thirty screening of L ove and Death at the National Film Theatre. Happy endings – for now at least.
