0600|six|The next morning, Sister Veronica is still at prayer in the chapel. At six, when the other sisters file in for Vigils, she is there, prostrate before the cross, her arms outstretched, her forehead touching the cold stone tile. It is only when they lean forward to touch her arm gently that the women see that the blood has settled in her face. She has been dead for many hours.
0600|six|Sammy was bright awake at six, giddy with excitement, Daddy was coming, and no settling him to anything. By late morning he was climbing the walls; I suggested we go for a walk, take a little picnic. He didn’t want to leave in case Daddy came while we were gone.<br>“How ’bout we head up the hill? We can look out for him from there. Like pirates.”<br>And that did the trick.
0600|six|Monday morning. I woke at six with my head pillowed on Patrick’s chest, my knee over his thigh. I’d slept all night without surfacing once. I don’t know when I had last slept like that.<br>He got up to make coffee and we drank it in bed.
0600|six|Dan lay awake until six. Then he dressed and once more made the trek to the Red Apple. This time he did not hesitate, only instead of extracting two bottles of Bird from the cooler, he took three. What was it they used to say? Go big or go home.
0600|six in the morning|The day after Olga was released from the hospital she commenced making shoes again. At six in the morning she is at her bench; she knocks out two pairs of shoes a day. Eugene complains that Olga is a burden, but the truth is that Olga is supporting Eugene and his wife with her two pairs of shoes a day. If Olga doesn’t work there is no food. So everyone endeavors to pull Olga to bed on time, to give her enough food to keep going, etc.
0600|Six o’clock|Ursula invites me into the wardrobe. “You haven’t aged a day, Timbo, and neither has 𝘵𝘩𝘪𝘴 snaky fellow!” Her furry fawn rubs up against my Narnian-sized lamppost and mothballs . . . but then, as ever, I awoke, my swollen appendage as welcome as a swollen appendix, and as useful. Six o’clock. The heating systems composed works in the style of John Cage. Chillblains burned my toe knuckles. I thought about Christmases gone, so many more gone than lay ahead.
0600|six|Amazingly, the routines of everyday life lurched along as spring dissolved into flamboyant summer. Holly rose every morning at six, walked and fed Buster, roused her children, made sure the youngest dressed appropriately for school, fed them, nestled lunch boxes into their backpacks, waited at the corner for the bus, waved them off.
0600|six AM|When she woke up, the inarguably sane light of six AM was streaming through the windows. There were things that needed to be done and decisions that needed to be made, but for the moment it was enough to be alive and in her own bed instead of stuffed into a culvert.
0600|six o’clock|“Well, good night, Pooh,” said Piglet, when they had got to Pooh’s house. “And we meet at six o’clock tomorrow morning by the Pine Trees, and see how many Heffalumps we’ve got in our Trap.”
0600|6:00 a.m.|Lars watched from his living room window as the family, who must’ve left Iowa around 6:00 a.m. to arrive here so early, trudged through the snow toward the lobby of his building.
0600|six A.M.|On Sunday morning he was woken at six A.M. by the telephone. It was Major Heathcote, and he got straight to the point. “What do you know about this mob at the cathedral?”
0600|six o’clock|And ever since that, the Hatter went on in a mournful tone, "he won’t do a thing I ask! It’s always six o’clock now."
0600|six o’clock|What’s the time? I ask, and telling him so that he knows, "My mother likes 'peace and quiet' to sleep late on Saturday mornings."<br/>"She does, does she? It’s six o’clock. I couldn’t sleep," he says wearily, like an afterthought, as if it’s what he expects. "Why are you up so early?"<br/>"I woke up and needed my panda. I can’t find him."
0600|six|But every morning, even if there's been a nighttime session and he has only slept two hours, he gets up at six and reads his paper while he drinks a strong cup of coffee. In this way Papa constructs himself every day.
0600|six a.m.|I had risen half-an-hour before her entrance, and had washed my face, and put on my clothes by the light of a half-moon just setting, whose rays streamed through the narrow window near my crib. I was to leave Gateshead that day by a coach which passed the lodge gates at six a.m.
0600|six|Lying awake in my attic room, I hear a clock strike six downstairs. It was fairly light and people were beginning to walk up and down the stairs.
0600|six o'clock|On the 15th of September 1840, about six o'clock in the morning, the Ville-de-Montereau, ready to depart, pouring out great whirls of smoke by the quai Saint-Bernard.
0600|six|The ball went on for a long time, until six in the morning; all were exhausted and wishing they had been in bed for at least three hours; but to leave early was like proclaiming the party a failure and offending the host and hostess who had taken such a lot of trouble, poor dears.
