0026|12.26 am|A Mr. Dutta from King's Cross called and told me you were on your way. He said you wanted to see the arrival of yesterday's 12.26 am. It'll take me a few minutes to cue up the footage. Our regular security bloke isn't here today; he's up before Haringey Magistrates' Court for gross indecency outside the headquarters of the Dagenham Girl Pipers.
