1500|three o'clock|Gunther's two conflicting feelings about Christmas almost rubbed each other out on the First Sunday in Advent. By three o'clock the fear feeling had practically vanished.
1500|three|At three that afternoon it was Peter who raised her from the semidaze in which she had been working, making her aware she was two damn-nears: damn-near starving and damn-near exhausted.
1500|It’s three o’clock|The little velociraptor opened her jaws and hissed at Grant, in a posture of sudden intense fury.<br>“Fascinating,” Grant said.<br>“Can I stay and play with her?” Tim said.<br>“Not right now,” Ed Regis said, glancing at his watch. “It’s three o’clock, and it’s a good time for a tour of the park itself, so you can see all the dinosaurs in the habitats we have designed for them.”
1500|Three o’clock|Three o’clock is always too late or too early for anything you want to do. An odd moment in the afternoon.
1500|three o’clock|A few moments later, about three o’clock, Courfeyrec chanced to be passing along the Rue Mouffetard in company with Bossuet. The snow had redoubled in violence, and filled the air.
1500|three o’clock on the afternoon|At three o’clock on the afternoon there was a loud peal at the bell, an authoritative voice in the hall, and, to my surprise, no less a person than Mr. Athelney Jones was shown up to me. Very different was he, however, from the brusque and masterful professor of common sense who had taken over the case so confidently at Upper Norwood. His expression was downcast, and his bearing meek and even apologetic.
1500|three o’clock|“Then good-night, your majesty, and I trust that we shall soon have some good news for you. And good-night, Watson,” he added, as the wheels of the royal brougham rolled down the street. “If you will be good enough to call to-morrow afternoon at three o’clock I should like to chat this little matter over with you.”
1500|three|The next afternoon at three, I went to meet the new teacher. When I stepped inside Julian’s office I was shocked. It was completely empty. The books, the rugs, the big round table were all gone.
1500|three o’clock in the afternoon|At about three o’clock in the afternoon, my whole body is hit by an overwhelming tiredness and I spent the last couple of hours of the day perusing the gift shop for stuffed koalas for Kay and Olivia and chilling out at a table inside the air-conditioned café.
1500|three|All the doors were locked, everything in its proper place. Nothing out of the ordinary. I went back to the janitor’s room, set my alarm for three, and fell fast asleep.
1500|three|When the alarm went off at three, though, I woke up feeling weird. I can’t explain it, but I just felt different. I didn’t feel like getting up—it was like something was suppressing my will to get out of bed. I’m the type who usually leaps right out of bed, so I couldn’t understand it.
1500|three o’clock|Luisa crosses the office to Dom Grelsch’s door. Her boss is speaking on the phone in a low, irate voice. Luisa waits outside but overhears. “No—no, no, Mr, Frum, it 𝘪𝘴 black-and-white, tell me—hey, 𝘐’𝘮 talking now—tell me a 𝘮𝘰𝘳𝘦 black-and-white ‘condition’ than leukemia? Know what I think? I think my wife is just one piece of paperwork between you and your three o’clock golf slot, isn’t she?”
1500|Three o’clock|Jarvis whistled through his teeth. “Will the law help a man of your years bounce back from multiple spinal fractures, Timothy?”<br>Eddie: “Men of your age don’t bounce. They splat.”<br>I fought with all my might, but my sphincter was no longer my own and a cannonade fired off. Amusement or condescension I could have borne, but my tormentors’ pity signified my abject defeat. The toilet chain was pulled.<br>“Three o’clock,” Cavendish-Redux went down the pan.
1500|Three o’clock|I had pushed too hard. “Damn it to hell, Tim, my bank 𝘤𝘳𝘢𝘴𝘩𝘦𝘥! We were bled dry by those bloodsuckers at Lloyds! The days when I had that kind of spondulics at my beck and call are gone, gone, gone! Out house is mortgaged, twice over! I’m the mighty fallen, you’re the miniscule fallen. Anyway, you’ve got this ruddy book flying out of every bookshop in the known world!”<br>My face said what I had no words for.<br>“Oh Christ, you idiot. What’s the repayment schedule?”<br>I looked at my watch. “Three o’clock this afternoon.”
1500|three o’clock|By three o’clock, the heat had morphed into a feral creature, a snake bent on prey. It hissed and slithered across the pavements, poked its flaming tongue through keyholes. People inched closer t their fans, sucked harder on ice cubes and opened the windows, only to close them instantly.
1500|three|When the clock struck three, Elizabeth felt that she must go, and very unwillingly said so. Miss Bingley offered her the carriage, and she only wanted a little pressing to accept it, when Jane testified such concern in parting with her, that Miss Bingley was obliged to convert the offer of the chaise to an invitation to remain at Netherfield for the present.
1500|three o’clock in the afternoon|I sat down on the woodpile we kept under a swatch of canvas on this side of the house. “I imagine you’re out here on business. My wife’s.”<br>“I am.”<br>“Well, you’ve had your drink, so we better get down to it. I’ve still got a full day’s work ahead of me, and it’s three o’clock in the afternoon.”
1500|three o’clock in the afternoon|The storm swept through all of Europe, raging through the night and on into the next day, and when Cromwell died at three o’clock in the afternoon it was still desolating the island.
1500|three o’clock precisely|At three o’clock precisely I was at Baker Street, but Holmes had not yet returned.
1500|three o’clock|And now it was three o’clock. The Antichrist had been on Earth for fifteen hours, and one angel and one demon had been drinking solidly for three of them.
1500|three|The city clocks had only just gone three, but it was quite dark already—it had not been light all day—and candles were flaring in the windows of the neighbouring offices, like ruddy smears upon the palpable brown air.
1500|three o’clock|Dating from three o’clock yesterday. My perpetual influence could not begin earlier, or you would not have been so much out of humour before.
1500|three-o’clock|Amory saw girls doing things that even in his memory would have been impossible: eating three-o’clock, after-dance suppers in impossible cafes, talking of every side of life with an air half of earnestness, half of mockery, yet with a furtive excitement that Amory considered stood for a real moral let-down. But he never realized how wide-spread it was until he saw the cities between New York and Chicago as one vast juvenile intrigue.
1500|three o’clock|The afternoon waned from the purging good of three o’clock to the golden beauty of four.
1500|three o’clock|With some difficulty, James battled his way past waves of scent, screeching voices and glossy black hair. <br>“What on earth is going on?” he asked when he reached the safety of his office.<br>Carlo shrugged. “It’s three o’clock.”<br>“I’m aware of the time, Carlo. Why are there so many women outside?”<br>“They are the 𝘧𝘪𝘥𝘢𝘯𝘻𝘢𝘵𝘦. The women who want to marry Allied servicemen.”
1500|three o'clock|I gotta get uptown by three o'clock.
1500|three o'clock|Remember, they shouted, "battle at three o'clock sharp. There's no time to lose."
1500|three|And the sound of the bell flooded the room with its melancholy wave; which receded, and gathered itself together to fall once more, when she heard, distractedly, something fumbling, something scratching at the door. Who at this hour? Three, good Heavens! Three already!
1500|three o'clock|At three o'clock on the afternoon of that same day, he called on her. She held out her two hands, smiling in her usual charming, friendly way; and for a few seconds they looked deep into each other's eyes.
1500|three|At three on the Wednesday afternoon, that bit of the painting was completed.
1500|three|Ditched by the woman I loved, I exalted my suffering into a sign of greatness (lying collapsed on a bed at three in the afternoon), and hence protected myself from experiencing my grief as the outcome of what was at best a mundane romantic break-up. Chloe's departure may have killed me, but it had at least left me in glorious possession of the moral high ground. I was a martyr.
1500|three o'clock|He walks into the Hospital for Broken Things at three o'clock on Monday afternoon. That was the arrangement. If he came in after six o'clock, he was to head straight for the house in Sunset Park.
1500|three o’clock|I had a three o’clock class in psychology, the first meeting of the semester, and I suspected I was going to miss it. I was right. Victoria made a real ritual of the whole thing, clothes coming off with the masturbatory dalliance of a strip show, the covers rolling back periodically to show this patch of flesh or that, strategically revealed.
1500|three o'clock|It was three o'clock in the beautiful breezy autumn day when Mr. Casaubon drove off to his Rectory at Lowick, only five miles from Tipton; and Dorothea, who had on her bonnet and shawl, hurried along the shrubbery and across the park that she might wander through the bordering wood with no other visible companionship than that of Monk, the Great St. Bernard dog, who always took care of the young ladies in their walks
1500|three-o’clock|Ladies bathed before noon, after their three-o’clock naps, and by nightfall were like soft teacakes with frostings of sweat and sweet talcum.
1500|three o'clock|M. Madeleine usually came at three o'clock, and as punctuality was kindness, he was punctual.
1500|three o'clock|On Wednesday at three o'clock, Monsieur and Madame Bovary, seated in their dog-cart, set out for Vaubyessard, with a great trunk strapped on behind and a bonnet-box in front of the apron. Besides these Charles held a bandbox between his knees.
1500|At three|The scent and smoke and sweat of a casino are nauseating at three in the morning. Then the soul-erosion produced by high gambling - a compost of greed and fear and nervous tension - becomes unbearable and the senses awake and revolt from it.
1500|three o'clock|Three o'clock is the perfect time in Cham, because anything is possible. You can still ski, but also respectably start drinking, the shops have just reopened, the sun is still up. Three o'clock is never too late or too early.
1500|three o'clock|Today was the day Alex had appointed for her 'punishment'. I became increasingly nervous as the hour of three o'clock approached. I was alone in the house, and paced restlessly from room to room, glancing at the clocks in each of them.
