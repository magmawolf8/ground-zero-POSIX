1300|one o'clock sharp|Guess what! said Klaus as he spooned lentil soup into Gunther's mouth at the noon meal in Gaza. "I have the honor of being the first man in Gaza to meet the medical examiners. At one o'clock sharp in Hebron."

1300|one o’clock|A tub was brought in to melt snow for mortar. They heard somebody saying it was twelve o’clock already.<br/>“It’s sure to be twelve,” Shukhov announced. “The sun’s over the top already.”<br/>“If it is,” the captain retorted, “it’s one o’clock, not twelve.”<br/>“How do you make that out?” Shukhov asked in surprise. “The old folk say the sun is highest at dinnertime.”<br/> “Maybe it was in their day!” the captain snapped back. “Since then it’s been decreed that the sun is highest at one o’clock.”<br/>“Who decreed that?”<br/>“The Soviet government.”
1300|one o’clock|It was one o’clock when we left No. 3, Lauriston Gardens. Sherlock Holmes led me to the nearest telegraph office, whence he dispatched a long telegram. He then hailed a cab, and ordered the driver to take us to the address given us by Lestrade
1300|one o’clock|He bought them day passes, using cash. They rode some rides and then had a late lunch at Rock Lobster, the seafood place down by the concert hall. That was just past one o’clock. As for the time of death, you probably know how they establish it. . . contents of the stomach and so on.
1300|one o’clock|Today it is lovely again, and along the Champs-Élysées at twilight it is like an outdoor seraglio choked with dark-eyed houris. The trees are in full foliage and of a verdure so pure, so rich, that it seems as though they were still wet and glistening with dew. From the Palais du Louvre to the Etoile it is like a piece of music for the pianoforte.

At nine this morning I was there, just as the doors were being opened, and again at one o’clock.
1300|one o’clock in the afternoon|A silver carriage clock in Judith Rey’s Ewingsville home tinkles one o’clock in the afternoon. Bill Smoke is being talked at by a financier’s wife. “This house never fails to bring out the demon of covetousness in me,” the fifty-something bejeweled woman confides, “it’s a copy of a Frank Lloyd Wright, The original’s on the outskirts of Salem, I believe.”
1300|one o’clock|“Oh, I’m a thinker all right,” McMurphy says, and they walk off together down the hall. When they come back what seems like days later, they’re both grinning and talking and happy about something. The doctor is wiping tears off his glasses and looks like he’s actually been laughing, and McMurphy is back as loud and full of brass and swagger as ever. He’s that way all through lunch, and at one o’clock he’s the first one in his seat for the meeting, his eyes blue and ornery from his place in the corner.
1300|one o’clock|He had a long-distance phone call from Portland and was down in the phone lobby with one of the black boys, waiting for the party to call again. When one o’clock came around and we went to moving things, getting the day room ready, the least black boy asked if she wanted him to go down and get McMurphy and Washington for the meeting, but she said no, it was all right, let him stay—besides, some of the men here might like a chance to discuss our Mr. Randle Patrick McMurphy in the absence of his dominating presence.
1300|one o’clock|“Can’t do it, Findle; I’m with somebody else! Call me up to-morrow about one o’clock!”
1300|one|The more he thought about it the more puzzled he was. He didn’t understand this revolver business. Somebody in the house had got that revolver. Downstairs a clock struck one.
1300|one|I think, he said, with a triumphant smile, "that I may safely expect to find the person I seek in the dining-room, fair lady."<br/>"There may be more than one."<br/>"Whoever is there, as the clock strikes one, will be shadowed by one of my men; of these, one, or perhaps two, or even three, will leave for France to-morrow. One of these will be the `Scarlet Pimpernel.'"

1300|1 pm|Gottfried Rembke arrived at 1 pm precisely. The moment he walked into the restaurant, handed his coat to the waiter, they knew it was him. The solid, stocky body, the gleaming pate, the open expression, the vigorous handshake: everything about him radiated ease and enthusiasm.
1300|one o'clock|I got to Schmidt's early, feeling horribly nervous. At one o'clock sharp: Toni. She was looking at the menu she knew well - Schmorbraten? Schnitzel? - when he loomed over her. I had seen him come in. She looked up, through him, at me. "Traitor." Jamie, hovering, looking very big, said her pet name, a German diminutive chosen by her.
1300|thirteen|It was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen.
1300|one o'clock|It was one o'clock. I bought some apples and a small pork pie and drove across the bridge to the other side of the riverbank in the direction of Orford Ness.
1300|At one|Many moons passed by. Did Baboon ever fly? Did he ever get to the sun? I’ve just heard today That he’s well on his way! He’ll be passing through Acton at one.
1300|one o'clock|That day it was one o'clock before John and Roger rowed across and went up to Dixon's farm for the milk and a new supply of eggs and butter.
1300|one o'clock|The day-room floor gets cleared of tables and at one o'clock the doctor comes out of his office down the hall, nods once at the nurse as he goes past where he's watching out of her window, sits in his chair just to the left of the door.
