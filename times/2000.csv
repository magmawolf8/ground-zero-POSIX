2000|eight o’clock|Charlie glanced at the clock over the bar and saw it was eight o’clock, but the other men were coming over to talk, and he realized he might not be able to pry his father loose from the gaggle of admirers. Especially if they brought him drinks.
2000|8:00 P.M.|The ten directors now sitting in the conference room were irritable and impatient. It was 8:00 P.M. They had been talking among themselves for the last ten minutes, but slowly had fallen silent.
2000|Eight o’clock|On the wall above the cupboard, invisible save at night, by lamplight and even then evincing an enigmatic profundity because it had but one hand, a cabinet clock ticked, then with a preliminary sound as if it had cleared its throat, struck five times.<br>"Eight o’clock," Dilsey said.
2000|eight o’clock|“My fiddle would be the better for new strings,” he remarked. “Put your pistol in your pocket. When the fellow comes, speak to him in an ordinary way. Leave the rest to me. Don’t frighten him by looking at him too hard.”<br>“It is eight o’clock now,” I said, glancing at my watch.
2000|eight o’clock|The mother nodded. She didn’t seem able to get out a word. The daughter burst into tears. I felt more than ever that these people knew something of the matter.<br>“At what o’clock did Mr. Drebber leave your house for the train?” I asked.<br>“At eight o’clock,” she said, gulping in her throat to keep down her agitation.
2000|eight o’clock|I have been drunk just twice in my life, and the second time was that afternoon; so everything that happened has a dim, hazy cast over it, although until after eight o’clock the apartment was full of cheerful sun.
2000|eight o’clock|Again at eight o’clock, when the dark lanes of the Forties were lined five deep with throbbing taxicabs, bound for the theatre district, I felt a sinking in my heart. Forms leaned together in the taxis as they waited, and voices sang, and there was laughter from unheard jokes, and lighted cigarettes outlined unintelligible 70 gestures inside.
2000|Eight o’clock|Eight o’clock, no later, you light the lamps, the big one by the large window, the small one on your desk, they are not to see by— It is still twilight out over the sand, the scrub oaks and cranberries, even the small birds have not settled. For sleep yet, out of the reach of prowling foxes. No, you light the lamps because you are alone in your small house and the wicks sputtering gold are like two visitors with good stories.
2000|eight o’clock|She stared back, surprised and confused. Then defiant. Abruptly she closed the laptop, stuffed it in her bag. She withdrew a pen and scribbled an address on a napkin. “If you change your mind,” she said stiffly, standing, “I will be at this location between eight o’clock and nine o’clock tonight.”
2000|8:00 p.m.|It was nearly 8:00 p.m., and Sully was glad to see the lights still on. With no Internet service of his own, and the computers at the Gazette being out of the question (he didn’t want anyone to know what he was doing, least of all reporters), this was his best and only option for doing research; a place where he once wrote grade-school book reports.
2000|Eight o’clock|Eight o’clock the walls whirr and hum into full swing. The speaker in the ceiling says, “Medications,” using the Big Nurse’s voice.
2000|eight|“I’ll give you a ride, of course!” Sarah said, slapping Kendra’s shoulder. “It’s really no problem.”<br>Kendra grabbed where she’d been slapped. “We start at eight?” she said, kneading her shoulder.
2000|eight|Then the grandfather’s clock in the hall outside struck eight, and the memory of the night before came to him.
2000|8 o’clock|“Mr. Owen - unfortunately delayed - unable to get here till tomorrow. Instructions -<br>everything they wanted - if they would like to go to their rooms?… dinner would be at 8 o’clock…”
2000|eight o'clock|'TIS eight o'clock, a clear March night, The moon is up, the sky is blue, The owlet, in the moonlight air, Shouts from nobody knows where; He lengthens out his lonely shout, Halloo! halloo! a long halloo!
2000|eight|I trace the words, "I'll arrive to collect you for drinks at eight on Saturday."
2000|8.00 p.m.|8.00 p.m. Have a bath
2000|eight o'clock|Arthur thought he could even bear to listen to the album of bagpipe music he had won. It was eight o'clock and he decided he would make himself, force himself, to listen to the whole record before he phoned her.
2000|eight o'clock|At eight o'clock that evening, a Saturday, Pamela Chamcha stood with Jumpy Joshi - who had refused to let her go unaccompanied - next to the Photo-Me machine in a corner of the main concourse of Euston station, feeling ridiculously conspiratorial.
2000|eight|Freud had me knock on Jung's door, to no avail. They waited until eight, then set off for Brill's without him.
2000|eight o'clock|It's the twenty-third of June nineteen seventy-five, and it is eight o'clock in the evening, seated at his jigsaw puzzle, Bartlebooth has just died.
2000|eight o'clock|She looked at her watch- it was eight o'clock
2000|eight in the evening|That day he forgot to go to dinner; he noticed the fact at eight in the evening, and as it was too late to go to the Rue St. Jaques, he ate a lump of bread.
2000|eight|The clock struck eight. Had it been ten, Elinor would have been convinced that at that moment she heard a carriage driving up to the house; and so strong was the persuasion that she did, in spite of the almost impossibility of their being already come, that she moved into the adjoining dressing-closet and opened a window-shutter, to be satisfied of the truth. She instantly saw that her ears had not deceived her.
2000|eight o’clock|Upon one of the largest and most beautiful of the steamers which ever glided down the shining pathway of the river upon a moonlight night of summer, I stepped, at eight o’clock in the evening, accompanied by several of my friends, and carrying in my pocket a box of boluses. The gangplank was drawn in, and we were on our way.
