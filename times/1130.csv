1130|11:30 A.M.|At 11:30 A.M., Charlie ran out the school’s front door, jumped, and cleared all six concrete steps. He tore down the walk as fast as he could, his Red-Ball Jets slapping the pavement all the way to the street.
1130|11:30 a.m.|It was Tuesday-my half day-and at 11:30 a.m. a call came in. An eversion of the uterus in a cow. This is the tough job in the country practice and I felt the usual chill.
1130|eleven-thirty|Five minutes later another truck pulls up behind the first. On the side of this one is a grinning cartoon boy woofing down a double cheeseburger. At eleven-thirty, while people are lined up for burgers and fries and tacos and enchiladas, a hotdog wagon appears.
1130|11:30|I woke up in a panic, not screaming, just a groan from deep in my throat. I’d dozed off in the hard plastic chair by the window. The clock above the door showed 11:30 and the ICU was dead silent. Adrenaline supply not yet depleted, I staggered to my feet.

1130|half-past eleven|O, Frank - I made a mistake! - I thought that church with the spire was All Saints', and I was at the door at half-past eleven to a minute as you said.
1130|half-past eleven|Thank-you, said C.B. quietly; but as he hung up his face was grim. In a few minutes he would have to break it to John that, although they had braved such dreadful perils dring the earlier part of the night they had, after all, failed to save Christina. Beddows had abjured Satan at a little after half-past eleven. By about eighteen minutes the Canon had beaten them to it again.
1130|11.30|This time it was Kumiko. The wall clock said 11.30.
