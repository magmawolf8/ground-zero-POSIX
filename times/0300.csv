0300|3:00 A.M.|At 3:00 A.M., a gray DeSoto Diplomat cruised up and down Oliver Avenue. The lone occupant looked for any sign of movement---anything out of the ordinary.
0300|three o'clock in the morning|Worst of all was that Henrick used such pointed and mercilessly concrete examples. If he was preaching about mercy, he would describe the lot of the poor in such a way that the people could picture someone of the captain's many crofters leaving his home at three o'clock in the morning with a sack of grain on his back, how he slaved in the fields, how he often must go without the noon meal in order to get to the mill at last after thirteen hours of labor and after picking up his flour, return home through the woods, carrying his heavy load.
0300|three in the morning|The scent and smoke and sweat of a casino are nauseating at three in the morning.
0300|three o’clock in the morning|Holly gets up at three o’clock in the morning. She’s packed, she’s printed out her Delta ticket, she doesn’t have to be at the airport until seven and it’s a short ride, but she can’t sleep anymore.
0300|3 a.m.|Who was that woman? She’d suspect, then be wrong. The shadowy presence laughed at her softly from the sleepless darkness of 3 a.m., then slid away. She couldn’t pin anything down.
0300|three o’clock in the morning|“What are you doing?” he asked.<br>“I thought it would be better if we locked the doors,” said Willa. “Just in case.”<br>“It’s three o’clock in the morning.”<br>“All the more reason for it.”<br>Markovic looked at her oddly before returning to the lounge.
0300|3 a.m.|The American team had flown into Vienna on a Gulfstream jet from a regional airport in eastern Poland, where the CIA had maintained a base for rendition purposes since the start of the War on Terror. It was not, therefore, the unit’s first day at the office. They were already watching when, at 3 a.m., two cars rook up positions within sight of the main and rear doors of the hotel, the first of the vehicles having initially circles the block three times.
0300|three a.m.|Tony was hardened off early. This is what she calls it by now, ruefully, in her cellar, at three a.m., with the shambles of Otto the Red’s clove army strewn on the sand-table behind her and West sleeping the sleep of the unjust upstairs, and Zenia raging unchecked, somewhere out there in the city.
0300|three|Hour after hour passed away, and the wearied Catherine had heard three proclaimed by all the clocks in the house before the tempest subsided or she unknowingly fell fast asleep.
0300|3 a.m.|“Uncle Nuri!” he says when he sees me moving. “You’ve been sleeping for such a long time.” The clock on the wall says 3 a.m.
0300|three a.m.|Mindy Park stared at the ceiling. She had little else to do. The three a.m. shift was pretty dull. Only a constant stream of coffee kept her awake.
0300|3 a.m.|I found myself typing “serial killer” into the Google search box at 3 a.m.
0300|three o’clock|About three o’clock the four couples, frightened at their happiness, were sliding down the Russian mountains, a singular edifice which then occupied the heights of Beaujon, and whose undulating line was visible above the trees of the Champs Élysées.
0300|three o’clock|A few moments later, about three o’clock, Courfeyrec chanced to be passing along the Rue Mouffetard in company with Bossuet. The snow had redoubled in violence, and filled the air.
0300|three o’clock|I woke up half out of bed, the covers pulled loose and wound around me in a kind of shroud, heart pumping, clawing at my own mouth. It took several seconds for me to realize there was nothing in there. Nonetheless, I got up, went to the bathroom, and drank two glasses of water. I may have had worse dreams than the one that woke me at three o’clock on that Tuesday morning, but if so, I can’t remember them.
0300|three AM|As if it had roused him—perhaps it had—Lane lifted his head and looked at me. Tried to look at me; his eyes had come back level in their sockets, but were now pointing in opposite directions. That terrible image has never left my mind, and still comes to me at the oddest times: going through turnpike tollbooths, drinking a cup of coffee in the morning with the CNN anchors baying bad news, getting up to piss at three AM, which some poet or other has rightly dubbed the Hour of the Wolf.
0300|three in the morning|I looked around the room again. As always, the room was clean and orderly. <br>“People think of all kinds of things at three in the morning. We all do. That’s why we each have to figure out our own way of fighting it off.”<br>“You’re probably right,” I said.
0300|three a.m.|“Even animals think things over at three a.m.,” he said, as if remembering something. “Have you ever gone to the zoo at three a.m.?”<br>“No,” I answered vaguely. “No, of course not.”
0300|three|All the doors were locked, everything in its proper place. Nothing out of the ordinary. I went back to the janitor’s room, set my alarm for three, and fell fast asleep.
0300|three|When the alarm went off at three, though, I woke up feeling weird. I can’t explain it, but I just felt different. I didn’t feel like getting up—it was like something was suppressing my will to get out of bed. I’m the type who usually leaps right out of bed, so I couldn’t understand it.
0300|3 a.m.|The preliminaries over, having made peepee and blown his nose vigorously, he walks nonchalantly over to his wench and gives her a big, smacking kiss together with an affectionate pat on the rump. Her, the wench, I’ve never seen look anything but immaculate—even at 3 a.m., after an evening’s work. She looks exactly as if she had just stepped out of a Turkish bath.
0300|three o’clock in the morning|And now it is three o’clock in the morning and we have a couple of trollops here who are doing somersaults on the bare floor. Fillmore is walking around naked with a goblet in his hand, and that paunch of his is drumtight, hard as a fistula.
0300|Three o’clock|Jarvis whistled through his teeth. “Will the law help a man of your years bounce back from multiple spinal fractures, Timothy?”<br>Eddie: “Men of your age don’t bounce. They splat.”<br>I fought with all my might, but my sphincter was no longer my own and a cannonade fired off. Amusement or condescension I could have borne, but my tormentors’ pity signified my abject defeat. The toilet chain was pulled.<br>“Three o’clock,” Cavendish-Redux went down the pan.
0300|three o’clock in the morning|Indeed, at three o’clock in the morning in the village of Bishopthorpe, it is easy to believe the lie indulged in by its residents - that it is a place for good and quiet people to live good and quiet lives.
0300|three o’clock|The light on at three o’clock this Friday morning belongs to him, Rowan, the elder of the two Radley children. He is wide awake, despite having drunk six times the recommended dose of Night Nurse.
0300|three A.M.|Spent last night working on a rumbling ’cello 𝘢𝘭𝘭𝘦𝘨𝘳𝘰 lit by explosive triplets. Silence punctuated by breakneck mousetraps. Remember the church clock chiming three A.M. “I heard an owl,” Huckleberry Finn says, “away and off, who-whooing about somebody that was dead, and a whippowill and a dog crying about somebody that was going to die.”
0300|three in the morning|He couldn’t sleep that night, a tightness in his chest as if a serpent had wound its coils around him. At three in the morning the phone by his bed began to ring. Ada’s voice, almost unrecognizable, her gasps between words no less desperate than her sobs.
0300|three in the morning|When at three in the morning she was still awake, her mind ticking off all the ways she kept failing at parenting, she threw off her blanket and padded to the kitchen. The Scotch she poured went down warm and hit hot, and she took another swig before collapsing into bed and finally disconnecting.
0300|3:00 a.m.|It did not help, either, that she had been up half the night with Josie, who’d awakened from a nightmare<br>about a boa constrictor and refused to go back to sleep. Alex didn’t know who the other candidates were for this position, but she’d wager that they weren’t single moms who’d had to poke the radiator vents with a yardstick at 3:00 a.m. to prove that there weren’t any snakes hiding in the dark tunnels.
0300|three o’clock|And now it was three o’clock. The Antichrist had been on Earth for fifteen hours, and one angel and one demon had been drinking solidly for three of them.
0300|three|When the clock struck three, Elizabeth felt that she must go, and very unwillingly said so.
0300|three o’clock|A gambling fever swept through the sophomore class and they bent over the bones till three o’clock many a sultry night.
0300|three o'clock|She died this morning, very early, about three o'clock.
0300|Three in the morn.|Three a.m. That’s our reward. Three in the morn. The soul’s midnight. The tide goes out, the soul ebbs. And a train arrives at an hour of despair. Why?
0300|three o'clock|According to her watch it was shortly after three o'clock, and according to everything else it was night-time.
0300|At three am|At three am I was walking the floor and listening to Katchaturian working in a tractor factory. He called it a violin concerto. I called it a loose fan belt and the hell with it.
0300|three o' clock in the morning|At three o' clock in the morning Eurydice is bound to come into it. After all, why did I sit here like a telegrapher at a lost outpost if not to receive messages from everywhere about the lost Eurydice who was never mine to begin with but whom I lamented and sought continually both professionally and amateurishly.
0300|three o’clock in the morning|But at three o’clock in the morning, a forgotten package has the same tragic importance as a death sentence, and the cure doesn’t work -- and in a real dark night of the soul it is always three o’clock in the morning, day after day.
0300|three o'clock|Not till she has had one cup of tea, so weak that it has a colour accidentally golden, can she begin her day. She is an insomniac. Her nights are wide-eyed and excited with worry. Even at three o'clock in the morning one might hear her eating a Bain Marie biscuit in the kitchen.
0300|3 a.m.|I slam the phone down but it misses the base. I hit the clock instead, which flashes 3 a.m.
0300|At three A.M.|It was six untroubled days later – the best days at the camp so far, lavish July light thickly spread everywhere, six masterpiece mountain midsummer days, one replicating the other – that someone stumbled jerkily, as if his ankles were in chains, to the Comanche cabin’s bathroom at three A.M.
0300|three in the morning|It was three in the morning when his taxi stopped by giant mounds of snow outside his hotel. He had not eaten in hours.
0300|three o'clock at night|Once I saw a figure I shall never forget. It was three o'clock at night, as I was going home from Blacky as usual; it was a short-cut for me, and there would be nobody in the street at this time of night, I thought, especially not in this frightful cold.
0300|Three AM|Roused from her sleep, Freya Gaines groped for the switch of the vidphone; groggily she found it and snapped it on. 'Lo,' she mumbled, wondering what time it was. She made out the luminous dial of the clock beside the bed. Three AM. Good grief.
0300|0300|Schact clears his mouth and swallows mightily. 'Tavis can't even regrout tile in the locker room without calling a Community meeting or appointing a committee. The Regrouting Committee's been dragging along since May. Suddenly they're pulling secret 0300 milk-switches? It doesn't ring true, Jim.
0300|Three in the morning|Three in the morning, thought Charles Halloway, seated on the edge of his bed. Why did the train come at that hour? For, he thought, it’s a special hour. Women never wake then, do they? They sleep the sleep of babes and children. But men in middle age? They know that hour well.
0300|three|What's the time? said the man, eyeing George up and down with evident suspicion, "why, if you listen you will hear it strike." <br /> George listened, and a neighbouring clock immediately obliged. "But it's only gone three!" said George in an injured tone, when it had finished.
0300|3:00 a.m.|When Sophie awoke, it was 3:00 a.m.
0300|three o’clock|You hearken, Missy. It’s three o’clock in the morning and I’ve got all my faculties as well as ever I had in my life. I know all my property and where the money’s put out. And I’ve made everything ready to change my mind, and do as I like at the last. Do you hear, Missy? I’ve got my faculties.
