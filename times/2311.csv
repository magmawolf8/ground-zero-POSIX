2311|eleven-eleven P.M.|The last recorded call on the victim's cell phone was Sunday night at eleven-eleven P.M. Nobody's seen her since that night.
2311|11:11 p.m.|Life changes fast. Life changes in an instant. You sit down to dinner and life as you know it ends. The Question of self-pity. Those were the first words I wrote after it happened. The computer dating on the Microsoft Word file ("Notes on change.doc") reads "May 20, 2004, 11:11 p.m.," but that would have been a case of my opening the file and reflexively pressing save when I closed it. I had made no changes to that file since I wrote the words, in January 2004, a day or two after the fact. For a long time I wrote nothing else. Life changes in the instant. The ordinary instant.
