1945|a quarter to eight o’clock|“There will call upon you to-night, at a quarter to eight o’clock,” it said, “a gentleman who desires to consult you upon a matter of the very deepest moment. Your recent services to one of the royal houses of Europe have shown that you are one who may safely be trusted with matters which are of an importance which can hardly be exaggerated.

Catheters are second-hand condoms the ends clipped off and rubber-banded to tubes that run down pantlegs to a plastic sack marked DISPOSABLE NOT TO BE RE-USED, which it is my job to wash out at the end of each day.

1945|19.45|He tells his old friend the train times and they settle on the 19.45 arriving at 23.27. "I'll book us into the ultra-luxurious Francis Drake Lodge. Running water in several rooms. Have you got a mobile?"
