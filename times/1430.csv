1430|2:30|So I opened the door again, got out a piece of paper and a thumbtack, and wrote:<br>Out briefly. Back for appointment at 2:30. Dresden<br>That done, I went to the stairs and started down. I rarely use the elevator, even though I’m on the fifth floor. Like I said, I don’t trust machines. They’re always breaking down on me just when I need them
1430|2:30|Ach! It's 2:30. Look how the time is flying. And it's still so much to do today.. It's dishes to clean, dinner to defrost, and my pills I haven't yet counted. I don't get it... Why didn't the Jews at least try to resist? It wasn't so easy like you think. Everybody was so starving and frightened, and tired they couldn't believe even what's in front of their eyes.

1430|1/2 past 2 o'clock|May 14th 1800. Wm and John set off into Yorkshire after dinner at 1/2 past 2 o'clock, cold pork in their pockets. I left them at the turning of the Low-wood bay under the trees. My heart was so full that I could barely speak to W. when I gave him a farewell kiss.
