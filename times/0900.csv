0900|nine|No trace of Inge was found that day or night. For some the search went on all night long. Then, about nine the next morning, the bells in the belfry of Zion Church began to ring wildly.
0900|nine o'clock|At nine o'clock the parsonage buggy carried them south on the highway toward Ravelunda. Fridfeldt felt more at home north of the church hamlet. There the revival had been more evident. Down here at Vänneberga it had one of its last outposts. Beyond it lay Sörbygden where the spiritual life was of another type. There one could both smoke and confess the Savior; there the doctrine of total sinful depravity was preached, and it was said whisky might be found also among the awakened.
0900|nine o’clock|Promptly at nine o’clock the next morning the green-whiskered soldier came to them, and four minutes later they all went into the Throne Room of the Great Oz.
0900|nine o’clock|She thought she had seen something different about Peter, but hadn’t been able to tell exactly what it was. When Anderson woke up the next morning (at a perfectly normal nine o’clock), she saw it almost at once.
0900|nine o’clock|The storm held off until nine o’clock, and by then Anderson was pretty sure they were going to have a good one - what Havenites called “a real Jeezer.”
0900|nine o’clock|By nine o’clock the next morning I was punctually opening the school; tranquil, settled, prepared for the steady duties of the day.
0900|nine o’clock|At nine o’clock his secretary came and read him his appointments for the day. <br>When he did so this morning, though, he found him still staring at his plate with a strange expression.
0900|nine o’clock in the morning|When I got off the train, I anxiously wondered where I should head for. Nightclubs were a great place to buy coke, but precious few were open at nine o’clock in the morning.
0900|nine|He’d woken up at nine, worked for a while in his room, and then said he felt sleepy. He went to the kitchen, made some coffee, and drank it. But the coffee didn’t help. <br/> “I think I’ll take a nap,” he said. “I hear a buzzing sound in the back of my head.” Those were his last words. He curled up in bed, went to sleep, and never woke up again.
0900|nine|From the Palais du Louvre to the Etoile it is like a piece of music for the pianoforte. For five days I have not touched the typewriter nor looked at a book; nor have I had a single idea in my head except to go to the American Express. At nine this morning I was there, just as the doors were being opened, and again at one o’clock.
0900|nine o’clock|He keeps smiling all the time, smiling like a rosy little bedbug that has had its fill. “It was nine o’clock,” he says once again, “when I called you up, wasn’t it?” I nod my head wearily. Yes, it was nine o’clock. He is certain now that it was nine o’clock because he remembers having taken out his watch.
0900|nine o’clock|At nine o’clock, I called again. He answered.<br>“What do you want?” he asked.<br>“I was hoping to hear you say you miss me.”<br>“I miss you,” he said. “Is that it?”<br>I hung up.
0900|nine o’clock|A work routine is developing. Ayrs and I are in the music room by nine o’clock every morning his various ailments and pains let him. I sit at the piano, Ayrs on the divan, smoking his vile Turkish cigarettes, and we adopt one of our three modi operandi. "Revisionals"—he asks me to run through the previous morning’s work. I hum, sing, or play, depending on the instrument, and Ayrs modifies the score.
0900|nine o’clock|There was no rain, as Holmes had foretold, and the morning broke bright and cloudless. At nine o’clock Lestrade called for us with the carriage, and we set off for Hatherley Farm and the Boscombe Pool.
0900|nine|“Don’t give it another thought, old sport.” The familiar expression held no more familiarity than the hand which reassuringly brushed my shoulder. “And don’t forget we’re going up in the hydroplane tomorrow morning, at nine.”
0900|nine o’clock|It was nine o’clock when we finished breakfast and went out on the porch. The night had made a sharp difference in the weather and there was an autumn flavor in the air.
0900|9:00 A.M.|The Earth was created on Sunday the 21st of October, 4004 B.C., at exactly 9:00 A.M., because God liked to get work done early in the morning while he was feeling fresh.
0900|nine in the morning|At only nine in the morning, the kitchen was already pregnant to its capacity, every crevice and countertop overtaken by Marjan’s gourmet creations. Marinating vegetables (𝘵𝘰𝘳𝘴𝘩𝘪𝘴 of mango, eggplant, and the regular seven-spice variety), packed to the briny brims of five-gallon see-through canisters sat on the kitchen island. Large blue bowls were filled with salads (angelica lentil, tomato, cucumber and mint, and Persian fried chicken), 𝘥𝘰𝘭𝘮𝘦𝘩, and dips (cheese and walnut, yogurt and cucumber, baba ghanoush, and spicy hummus), which along with feta, Stilton, and cheddar cheeses, were covered and stacked in the enormous glass-door refrigerator.
0900|nine o’clock|By the time he was fully dressed it was nine o’clock. There were six hours left until Hitler’s ultimatum expired.<br>He went in search of breakfast.
0900|nine o’clock|However, at nine o’clock the prince, in his velvet coat with a sable collar and cap, went out for his usual walk.
0900|nine o’clock|It was nine o’clock in the morning. The fog lay unbroken like a sea down below, but higher up at the village of Schlappanitz where Napoleon stood with his marshals around him, it was quite light. Above him was a clear blue sky, and the sun’s vast orb quivered like a huge hollow, crimson float on the surface of that milky sea of mist.
0900|nine o’clock|When the gong sounded for breakfast at nine o’clock it found every one up and awaiting the summons.
0900|nine o'clock|I could never get all the way down there before nine o'clock.
0900|nine o'clock|Look. Ignatius. I'm beat. I've been on the road since nine o'clock yesterday morning.
0900|nine|On the third morning after their arrival, just as all the clocks in the city were striking nine individually, and somewhere about nine hundred and ninety-nine collectively, Sam was taking the air in George Yard, when a queer sort of fresh painted vehicle drove up, out of which there jumped with great agility, throwing the reins to a stout man who sat beside him, a queer sort of gentleman, who seemed made for the vehicle, and the vehicle for him.
0900|9.00 a.m.|9.00 a.m. School assembly
0900|nine|A fly buzzed, the wall clock began to strike. After the nine golden strokes faded, the district captain began. "How is Herr Colonel Marek?"<br/> "Thank you, Papá, he's fine."<br/> "Still weak in geometry?"<br/> "Thank you, Papá, a little better."<br/> "Read any books?"<br/> "Yessir, Papá."
0900|nine o' clock|As nine o' clock was left behind, the preposterousness of the delay overwhelmed me, and I went in a kind of temper to the owner and said that I thought he should sign on another cook and weigh spars and be off.
0900|nine o'clock|At nine o'clock, one morning late in July, Gatsby's gorgeous car lurched up the rocky drive to my door and gave out a burst of melody from its three-noted horn.
0900|nine|He was at breakfast at nine, and for the twentieth time consulted his "Bradshaw", to see at what earliest hour Dr. Grantly could arrive from Barchester.
0900|nine o'clock|He won't stand beating. Now, if you only kept on good terms with him, he'd do almost anything you liked with the clock. For instance, suppose it were nine o'clock in the morning, just time to begin lessons: you'd only have to whisper a hint to Time, and round goes the clock in a twinkling! Half-past one, time for dinner!
0900|nine o'clock|It was around nine o'clock that I crossed the border into Cornwall. This was at least three hours before the rain began and the clouds were still all of a brilliant white. In fact, many of the sights that greeted me this morning were among the most charming I have so far encountered. It was unfortunate, then, that I could not for much of the time give to them the attention they warranted; for one may as well declare it, one was in a condition of some preoccupation with the thought that - barring some unseen complication - one would be meeting Miss Kenton again before the day's end.
0900|At nine|Opening his window, Aschenbach thought he could smell the foul stench of the lagoon. A sudden despondency came over him. He considered leaving then and there. Once, years before, after weeks of a beautiful spring, he had been visited by this sort of weather and it so affected his health he had been obliged to flee. Was not the same listless fever setting in? The pressure in the temples, the heavy eyelids? Changing hotels again would be a nuisance, but if the wind failed to shift he could not possibly remain here. To be on the safe side, he did not unpack everything. At nine he went to breakfast in the specially designated buffet between the lobby and the dining room.
0900|9.00 am|Sometimes what I wouldn't give to have us sitting in a bar again at 9.00 am telling lies to one another, far from God.
0900|nine|The clock struck nine when I did send the nurse; In half an hour she promised to return.
0900|nine|To where Saint Mary Woolnoth kept the hours<br/>With a dead sound on the final stroke of nine.
0900|Nine o’clock|Nine o’clock young residents wearing leather elbows talk to Acutes for fifty minutes about what they did when they were little boys. The Big Nurse is suspicious of the crew-cut looks of these residents, and that fifty minutes they are on the ward is a tough time for her.
