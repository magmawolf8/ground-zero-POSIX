1200|noon|Guess what! said Klaus as he spooned lentil soup into Gunther's mouth at the noon meal in Gaza. "I have the honor of being the first man in Gaza to meet the medical examiners. At one o'clock sharp in Hebron."
1200|noon|When Sister Anna brought him back to Patmos at noon, Gunther shouted to anyone and everyone within earshot, "I can read! I can read!"
1200|midday|You, Willi, my friend, said Pastor Fritz softly, "you who sit in midnight darkness at midday, is this Jesus Christ a horn of salvation, a light in your darkness?"
1200|midday|They were now on their way back toward the city that was flooded with midday sunlight. The sunlight was dense across the plain, and the mountains by Stjärnor disappeared in a blueish gray haze.
1200|noon|Fine dust in my mouth and nose, sifting through my cotton bandana. Grit in the corners of my eyes, in my ears, all through my hair. When we stopped for a noon meal, I felt as if my own flesh might change back into the dust that coated me.
1200|noon|Jubilee asked, "Won't you join us for lunch, Christopher?"<br/>"I would like that, but I'm afraid I'm on guard duty at the jail come noon. I'd best be going." 
1200|noon|It was noon and the light came in bursts through the choir windows, and even more through those of the facade, creating white cascades that, like mystic streams of divine substance, intersected at various points of the church, engulfing the altar itself.
1200|twelve o'clock|At twelve o'clock the bus came, and Torvik stood at the post office to meet it. Pastor Bengtsson alighted. He was a short, stocky man, with alert black eyes and rather thick rustic lips.
1200|twelve o'clock|At twelve o'clock the bus would be leaving with the morning mail. It was the last opportunity for the day to post the letter. He really ought not wait any longer with the application. But did he really dare take this step before he was sure of God's will? He prayed afresh.
1200|noon|Holly tries to ignore the headache her mother’s calls — and this call in particular — almost always bring on. She assures her mother that yes, she will be there on Sunday to help, and yes, she will be there by noon, so they can eat one more meal as a family.
1200|twelve o’clock|Then my doctor sent me to a psychiatrist at this big hospital. I had an appointment for twelve o’clock, and I was in an awful state.
1200|noon|When she woke up it was noon, and someone was pounding on the door. Probably it was West, come back because he’d forgotten something. (His underwear was gone from the drawer, his neatly arranged socks, washed by Tony and folded carefully in pairs. He’d taken a suitcase.)
1200|twelve o’clock|A tub was brought in to melt snow for mortar. They heard somebody saying it was twelve o’clock already.<br/>“It’s sure to be twelve,” Shukhov announced. “The sun’s over the top already.”<br/>“If it is,” the captain retorted, “it’s one o’clock, not twelve.”<br/>“How do you make that out?” Shukhov asked in surprise. “The old folk say the sun is highest at dinnertime.”<br/> “Maybe it was in their day!” the captain snapped back. “Since then it’s been decreed that the sun is highest at one o’clock.”<br/>“Who decreed that?”<br/>“The Soviet government.”
1200|noon|“Do you you include violin playing in your category of rows?” he asked, anxiously. <br>“It depends on the player,” I answered, “A well-played violin is a treat for the gods - a badly played one --”<br>“Oh, that’s all right, he cried, with a merry laugh. “I think we may consider the thing as settled — that is, if the rooms are agreeable to you.” <br>“When shall we see them?”<br>“Call for me at noon to-morrow, and we’ll go together and settle everything,” he answered.<br>“All right — noon exactly,” said I, shaking his hand.
1200|High noon|Prowling around aimlessly. A beautiful day—so far. The Rue de Buci is alive, crawling. The bars wide open and the curbs lined with bicycles. All the meat and vegetable markets are in full swing. Arms loaded with truck bandaged in newspapers. A fine Catholic Sunday—in the morning, at least.<br>High noon and here I am standing on an empty belly at the confluence of all these crooked lanes that reek with the odor of food.
1200|noon|“What’s the time?” he said to the clock. It dipped its head, sproinged upright again.<br>“It’s noon. It’s noon, it’s noon, it’s . . .”<br>“Shut up,” said Jimmy. The clock wilted. It was programmed to respond to harsh tones.
1200|twelve o’clock|“Excellent. You are not averse to this trip, Watson?”<br>“By no means.”<br>“Then we shall both come. What are you going to do yourself?”<br>“I have one or two things which I would wish to do now that I am in town. But I shall return by the twelve o’clock train, so as to be there in time for your coming.”
1200|noon|I am writing this at noon. Ben is downstairs, reading. He thinks I am resting but, even though I am tired, I am not. I don’t have time. I have to write this down before I lose it. I have to write my journal.
1200|noon|I did Danièle’s math in my head. “If we start at ten, walk for four hours, rest for one, walk for another two, that’s seven hours in total. That will take us to five in the morning. Seven hours back, it won’t be noon until we resurface.”
1200|noon|Mercutio: "'Tis is no less, I tell you, for the bawdy hand of the dial is now upon the prick of noon."
1200|noon|Before noon Stan takes her to the laundromat in one of the malls - they’ve used that one before, two of the machines are still working - and he watches the car while she does a load and then pays for it on their phone.
1200|noon|At noon each day every last one of them, from Don Bernardo the priest to the widow Esmerelda, the village prostitute, stopped work and strolled over to the Pertinis’ vine-shaded terrace, where for two hours they ate like royalty and drank wine made from the same grapes which ripened above their heads.
1200|twelve|There's nobody here! I insisted. "It was yourself, Mrs. Linton: you knew it a while since."<br/>"Myself!" she gasped, "and the clock is striking twelve!"
1200|twelve|A cheap little clock on the wall struck twelve hurriedly, and served to begin the conversation.
1200|noon|He had saved [the republic] and it was now in the present, alive now and everywhere in the present, and the hovering faces brightened and blurred about him, became the sound of a canal in the morning, the look of some roofs in the noon sun, and the fragrance of a certain evening flower. Here he was, home at last. Behind him were the mountains and the Sleeping Woman in the sky, and before him, like smoky flames in the sunset, the whole beautiful beloved city.
1200|twelve o’clock|It was precisely twelve o’clock; twelve by Big Ben; whose stroke was wafted over the northern part of London; blent with that of other clocks, mixed in a thin ethereal way with the clouds and wisps of smoke, and died up there among the seagulls.
1200|noon|Noon found him momentarily alone, while the family prepared lunch in the kitchen. The cracks in the ceiling widened into gaps. The locked wheels of his bed sank into new fault lines opening in the oak floor beneath the rug. At any moment the floor was going to give.
1200|noon|On Friday noon, July the twentieth, 1714, the finest bridge in all Peru broke and precipitated five travellers into the gulf below.
1200|noon|Roaring noon. In a well-fanned Forty-second Street cellar I met Gatsby for lunch.
1200|Noon|The Birds begun at Four o'clock<br/>Their period for Dawn<br/>A Music numerous as space<br/>But neighboring as Noon
1200|twelve|Christmas Eve, and twelve of the clock.<br/>"Now they are all on their knees,"<br/>An elder said as we sat in a flock<br/>By the embers in hearthside ease.<br/>We pictured the meek mild creatures where<br/>They dwelt in their strawy pen,<br/>Nor did it occur to one of us there<br/>To doubt they were kneeling then.<br/>So fair a fancy few would weave<br/>In these years! Yet, I feel,<br/>If someone said on Christmas Eve,<br/>“Come; see the oxen kneel,<br/>“In the lonely barton by yonder coomb<br/>Our childhood used to know,”<br/>I should go with him in the gloom,<br/>Hoping it might be so.
1200|noon|Then came the stroke of noon, and all these working and professional people dispersed like a trampled anthill into all the streets and directions. The white bridge was swarming with nimble dots. And when you considered that each dot had a mouth with which it was now planning to eat lunch, you couldn't help bursting into laughter.
1200|noon|One day, about the hour of noon, a little more than a week after my first experiment, I rolled twenty grains of hashish into a pill and swallowed it, saying as I did so, “Here is the final test for the sake of science.”
