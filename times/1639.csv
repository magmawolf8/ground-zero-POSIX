1639|4:39 p.m.|Harlem enjoys lazy Sabbath mornings, although the pace picks up again in the afternoon, after church. My watch read 4:39 p.m., and I realized that I hadn't eaten all day. I bought two slices of pizza from a sidewalk vendor on 122nd and Lenox Avenue and washed it down with a grape Snapple.
