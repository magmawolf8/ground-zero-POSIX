2300|eleven|Shanghai’s clocks were set an hour ahead so the city could "save daylight", but the Bai family said: “We go by the old clock.” Ten o’clock to them was eleven to everyone else. Their singing was behind the beat; they couldn’t keep up with the huqin [Chinese string instrument] producing bleak and desolate sounds of life.
2300|eleven o’clock|Tony and Zenia are having coffee, as they have done almost every third day now for the past month, ever since they met. Or not every third day, every third evening: right now it’s eleven o’clock, Tony’s usual bedtime, and here she is, still up. She isn’t even sleepy.
2300|eleven o’clock|It was nearly eleven o’clock when we reached this final stage of our night’s adventures. We had left the damp fog of the great city behind us, and the night was fairly fine. A warm wind blew from the west-ward, and heavy clouds moved slowly across the sky, with half a moon peeping occasionally through the rifts.
2300|eleven p.m.|There was no end to it. At first I made all the proper noises to show her I was following along, but soon gave up. I put on a record and when it was over, I lifted up the needle and put on another. After I finished all the records, I put the first one back on. Outside it was still pouring. Time passed slowly as her monologue went on without end.<br>I didn’t worry about it, though, until a while later. Suddenly I realized it was eleven p.m. and she had been talking nonstop for four hours.
2300|eleven o’clock|At eleven o’clock it was all settled; they were going to run away, to Borneo. F*** the husband! She never loved him anyway. She would never have written the first letter if the husband wasn’t old and passionless.
2300|eleven at night|I liked to think I’d chosen Dr. Tuttle at random, that there was something fated about our relationship, divine in some way, but in truth, she’d been the only psychiatrist to answer the phone at eleven at night on a Tuesday.
2300|eleven o’clock|Around eleven o’clock the door was unlocked. I readied myself to reject apologies and go for the jugular. A once stately woman sailed in. Seventy years old, eighty, eighty-five, who knows when they’re that old? A rickety greyhound in a blazer followed his mistress.
2300|eleven|There was a movement and an exclamation from my right, and peering through the gloom I saw Whitney, pale, haggard, and unkempt, staring out at me.<br>“My God! It’s Watson,” said he. He was in a pitiable state of reaction, with every nerve in a twitter. “I say, Watson, what o’clock is it?”<br>“Nearly eleven.”
2300|eleven o’clock|She left her room, therefore, and came into mine, where she sat for some time, chatting about her approaching wedding. At eleven o’clock she rose to leave me, but she paused at the door and looked back.<br> Tell me, Helen," said she, "have you ever heard anyone whistle in the dead of the night?"<br>"Never," said I."
2300|eleven|Two hours passed slowly away, and then, suddenly, just at the stroke of eleven, a single bright light shone out right in front of us.
2300|eleven o’clock at night|Five months ago, Ashley had shown up at Hud’s Airstream at eleven o’clock at night and said, “I broke up with him. And I think you should know that I love you.”
2300|eleven|Around eleven she and Stan have another doughnut. Then they make a hopeful stop at a dumpster out behind a soup joint, but no luck, the stuff has already been picked over.
2300|eleven|It was Eli, Bryan’s friend, the taller of the two. Jaidee reached for his hand, shook it. “Hi,” he said.<br>“Where you going?” Eli said. In a pink polo and khaki shorts, he looked bright against the wide panel of night. His eyes were happy, altered, no doubt, from liquor.<br>“I’m heading back,” he said.<br>Eli looked at his watch. “It’s only eleven.”<br>“I’m just tired,” Jaidee said. “Long day.”
2300|eleven at night|“That priest of yours is really funny. Did you know that they’re allowed to drink, these priests? No women, but alcohol is fine!” Bahar walked in waving Father Mahoney’s order. Her usually skittish eyes were bright and—dared Marjan hope?—happy?<br>“They drink beer like water here. Last Saturday I saw an entire family, with young kids, leaving the bar next door. At eleven at night!”
2300|eleven o’clock|But time passed, two hours of it, and the less subtle beaux had better learned to focus their pseudo-passionate glances elsewhere, for eleven o’clock found Isabelle and Amory sitting on the couch in the little den off the reading-room up-stairs. She was conscious that they were a handsome pair, and seemed to belong distinctively in this seclusion, while lesser lights fluttered and chattered down-stairs.
2300|eleven o’clock|“Your detention will take place at eleven o’clock tonight.<br>Meet Mr. Filch in the entrance hall.”
2300|At eleven|He will be here at eleven exactly, sir.<br/>At the bar, naked couples had begun dancing.
2300|eleven o'clock|At eleven o'clock that night, having secured a bed at one of the hotels and telegraphed his address to his father immediately on his arrival, he walked out into the streets of Sandbourne.
2300|eleven o'clock|At eleven o'clock, I rang the bell for Betteredge, and told Mr. Blake that he might at last prepare himself for bed.
2300|eleven o'clock|He says, "They've killed Jan. Clear out."<br/>"The suitcase?" I ask.<br/>"Take it away again. We want nothing to do with it now. Catch the eleven o'clock express."<br/> "But it doesn't stop here...."<br/>"It will. Go to track six. Opposite the freight station. You have three minutes."<br/>"But..."<br/>"Move, or I'll have to arrest you."
2300|eleven|The clock struck eleven. I looked at Adele, whose head leant against my shoulder; her eyes were waxing heavy, so I took her up in my arms and carried her off to bed. It was near one before the gentlemen and ladies sought their chambers.
2300|At eleven|The train arrived in New York at eleven that night.
2300|2300h|They didn't even sit down to eat until 2300h.
2300|eleven o’clock|I left the narration of my story while we were still walking toward the doctor’s. At length, reaching there, we found him still sitting in his office, although it was now eleven o’clock.
2300|eleven o'clock|When they reached the top of the Astronomy Tower at eleven o'clock, they found a perfect night for stargazing, cloudless and still.
