2337|eleven-thirty-seven P.M.|The last communication with the Teasdale had been at eleven-thirty-seven P.M., nearly a day and a half earlier, when the captain reported to the Coast Guard station at Duluth that he was altering the ship's course to seek shelter in the lee of the Apostle Islands. Because no other communication occurred, it was assumed that the ore carrier had made it safely and was waiting out the storm.
