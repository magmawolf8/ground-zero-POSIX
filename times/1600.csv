1600|four|At four you can go into the greenhouse and get two dozen daffodils to remind us of spring, that there is a spring.
1600|four o’clock|It was four o’clock, and they had another hour of daylight left before it would be time to quit. Charlie wanted to shoot his father’s gun as promised, though not at a duck, but he didn’t know if he dared ask.
1600|four o’clock|I followed his gaze to the mantelpiece. The clock had stopped at four o’clock.<br>“Mon ami, someone has tampered with it. It had still three days to run. It is an eight-day clock, you comprehend?”<br>“But what should they want to do that for? Some idea of a false scent by making the crime appear to have taken place at four o’clock?”
1600|four|It’s a delusional painter who finishes a canvas at two o’clock and expects radical societal transformation by four. Even when artists write manifestos, they are (hopefully) aware that their exigent tone is, finally, borrowed, only echoing and mimicking the urgency of the guerrilla’s demands, or the activist’s protests, rather than truly enacting it. The people sometimes demand change. They almost never demand art.
1600|four|“If ever you are passing my way," said Bilbo, "don’t wait to knock! Tea is at four, but any of you are welcome at any time.”
1600|four clock|At four clock, Eva unspools the finished Harvard reference from her typewriter, folds it neatly, and places it inside a good cream envelope. Then she shrugs on her coat, checks her handbag for car keys, purse, compact.
1600|four o’clock|But, with a throb of undiluted angst, I realized that I’d felt such restlessness and emptiness in the past. Often. It usually kicked in at about four o’clock on a Sunday, but had arrived slightly late today, no doubt still on New York time.
1600|four o’clock|It was four o’clock before we finally got away. Now, for some reason, it was Charles and Camilla who weren’t speaking. They’d fought about something - I’d seen them arguing in the yard - and all the way home, in the back seat, they sat side by side and stared straight ahead, their arms folded across their chests in what I am sure they did not realize was a comically identical fashion.
1600|four|Sammy woke, flushed and disoriented, around four that afternoon. We made our tea together. I put on bread to toast and I put soup in a pan to heat. Outside the weather worsened, tumbling up into a spring storm, all squalls and blusters. Sammy rode on my hip and we made a game of it as I walked around the house checking the window fixings and drawing the curtains, even though it wasn’t yet properly dark.
1600|four o’clock|They stood at the iron rail, not talking among themselves, just watching. And taking long slow deep breaths, like tourists from the Midwest standing for the first time on Pemaquid Point or Quoddy Head in Maine, breathing deep of the fresh sea air. As a sign of respect, Rose took off her tophat and held it by her side.<br>At four o’clock they trooped back to their encampment in the parking lot, invigorated. They would return the next day, and the day after that, and the day after that. They would return until the good steam was exhausted, and then they would move on.
1600|four in the afternoon|“Good morning, Dr. Tuttle,” I said.<br>“It’s four in the afternoon,” she said. “I’m sorry it took me so long to return your call. My cats had an emergency. Are you feeling better? The symptoms you described in your message, frankly, puzzle me.”
1600|four P.M.|Well, it had become pretty clear I wasn’t going to be able to catch E. on her own. She never appeared at the belfry at four P.M. That my communiqués were being intercepted was the only explanation that occurred to me.
1600|four o’clock|I propose myself the satisfaction of waiting on you and your family, Monday, November 18th, by four o’clock, and shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the Saturday se’ennight following, which I can do without any inconvenience, as Lady Catherine is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a Sunday, provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day.
1600|four o’clock|“At four o’clock, therefore, we may expect this peace-making gentleman," said Mr. Bennet, as he folded up the letter.
1600|four o’clock|It was nearly four o’clock when we at last, after passing through the beautiful Stroud Valley, and over the broad gleaming Severn, found ourselves at the pretty little country-town of Ross. A lean, ferret-like man, furtive and sly-looking, was waiting for us upon the platform.
1600|four o’clock|She lay down at four o’clock, not expecting to sleep a wink, but her healing body had its own priorities. She went under almost instantly, and when she woke to the insistent 𝘥𝘢𝘩-𝘥𝘢𝘩-𝘥𝘢𝘩 of her bedside clock, she was glad she had set the alarm. Outside, a gusty October breeze was combing leaves from the trees and sending them across her backyard in colorful skitters. The light had gone that strange and depthless gold which seems the exclusive property of late-fall afternoons in New England.
1600|four p.m.|So then my father refused to eat Christmas lunch with us, which my mother finally served at around four p.m., by which time we were all starving and quite drunk, and, well … it was a very dysfunctional Christmas Day.
1600|four o’clock in the afternoon|That’s enough to begin with, Humpty Dumpty interrupted: "there are plenty of hard words there. 'Brillig' means four o’clock in the afternoon — the time when you begin broiling things for dinner."
1600|4 p.m.|Please join us on Sunday February 2nd 2003 from 4 p.m. at the Hoxton Gallery, London N1, to preview a new exhibition of faecal paintings by Catherine Leidensteiner.
1600|four o’clock|Billy Bibbit and his girl mentioned that it was after four o’clock and, if it was all right, if people didn’t mind, they’d like to have Mr. Turkle unlock the Seclusion Room.
1600|four o’clock|“If you should have no objection to receive me into your house,<br>I propose myself the satisfaction of waiting on you and your family,<br>Monday, November 18th, by four o’clock, and shall probably trespass<br>on your hospitality till the Saturday se’ennight following, which I can<br>do without any inconvenience, as Lady Catherine is far from objecting<br>to my occasional absence on a Sunday, provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day.”
1600|four o’clock|Later in the morning, and just as the girls were going to separate in preparation for the regular four o’clock dinner, the hero of this inimitable charade walked in again.
1600|four o’clock|“Think of me to-morrow, my dear Emma, about four o’clock,” was Mrs. Weston’s parting injunction; spoken with some anxiety, and meant only for her.
1600|four|The afternoon waned from the purging good of three o’clock to the golden beauty of four.
1600|four o'clock|... when they all sat down to table at four o'clock, about three hours after his arrival, he had secured his lady, engaged her mother's consent, and was not only in the rapturous profession of the lover, but, in the reality of reason and truth, one of the happiest of men.
1600|four|What else can I answer, When the lights come on at four At the end of another year
1600|4.00 p.m.|4.00 p.m. Take Toby out of his cage
1600|four o'clock|As he turned off towards the fishing village of Cellardyke, the familiar pips announced the four o'clock news. The comforting voice of the newsreader began the bulletin. "The convicted serial killer and former TV chat show host Jacko Vance has begun his appeal against conviction."
1600|four|Charmian woke at four and sensed the emptiness of the house.
1600|four|Djerzinski arrived punctually at four o’clock. Desplechin had asked to see him. The case was intriguing. Certainly, it was common for a researcher to take a year’s sabbatical to work in Norway or Japan, or one of those sinister countries where middle aged people committed suicide en masse.
1600|four o'clock|Four o'clock: wedge-shaped gardens lie Under a cavernous, a wind-picked sky.
1600|four o'clock|Four o'clock: when time in the city quivers on its axis - the day not yet spent, the wheels of evening just beginning to turn. The handover hour, was how Marius liked to think of it.
1600|Four o’clock|Four o’clock has just struck. Good! Arrangement, revision, reading from four to five. Short snooze of restoration for myself, from five to six. Affair of agent and sealed letter from seven to eight. At eight, en route.
1600|four o'clock|He played for twenty-two days, just as he said he would. Every day at four o'clock in the afternoon, regardless of how much fighting was going on around him.
1600|four o’clock|Her eyes caught the kryptonite glow of the digital clock on the front of the microwave. Honest and true, the numbers spelled out the time although she, for a moment, found its calculation to be somehow erroneous. It was four o’clock in the afternoon.
1600|four o'clock|I doubt whether anyone was commissioned to send the news along the actual telegraph, and yet Mrs. Proudie knew it before four o'clock. But she did not know it quite accurately.<br/>"Bishop", she said, standing at her husband's study door. "They have committed that man to gaol. There was no help for them unless they had forsworn themselves."
1600|Four o’clock|I only found out much later that those flowers were called Four o’clock, and were not magic at all. The magic was in the seed, waiting to be watered and cared for, the real magic was life.
1600|four o’clock|In the end, it was the Sunday afternoons he couldn’t cope with, and that terrible listlessness that starts to set in about 2.55, when you know you’ve had all the baths you can usefully have that day, that however hard you stare at any given paragraph in the newspaper you will never actually read it, or use the revolutionary new pruning technique it describes, and that as you stare at the clock the hands will move relentlessly on to four o’clock, and you will enter the long dark teatime of the soul.
1600|struck four|In the four thousand rooms of the Centre the four thousand electric clocks simultaneously struck four. Discarnate voices called from the trumpet mouths.
1600|4 o'clock|It was my turn to cook the evening meal so I didn't linger in the common room. It was exactly 4 o'clock as I made my way out of the building, and doors opened behind and before me, discharging salvos of vocal babble and the noise of chair-legs scraping on wooden floors.
1600|1600h.|The horrifying R.N. wipes Gately's face off as best she can with her hand and says she'll try to fit him in for a sponge bath before she goes off shift at 1600h., at which Gately goes rigid with dread.
