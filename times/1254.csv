1254|12:54 pm|I listen to the different boats' horns, hoping to learn what kind of boat I'm hearing and what the signal means: is the boat leaving or entering the harbor; is it the ferry, or a whale-watching boat, or a fishing boat? At 5:33 pm there is a blast of two deep, resonant notes a major third apart. On another day there is the same blast at 12:54 pm. On another, exactly 8:00 am.
