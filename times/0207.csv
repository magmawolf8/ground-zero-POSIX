0207|2:07 a.m.|At 2:07 a.m. I decided that I wanted a drink of orange squash before I brushed my teeth and got into bed, so I went downstairs to the kitchen. Father was sitting on the sofa watching snooker on the television and drinking whisky. There were tears coming out of his eyes.
0207|2.07 a.m.|But I couldn't sleep. And I got out of bed at 2.07 a.m. and I felt scared of Mr. Shears so I went downstairs and out of the front door into Chapter Road.
0207|2.07 a.m.|Saturday, 17 November â€” 2.07 a.m. I cannot sleep. Ben is upstairs, back in bed, and I am writing this in the kitchen. He thinks I am drinking a cup of cocoa that he has just made for me. He thinks I will come back to bed soon. I will, but first I must write again.
