0745|seven-forty-five|This morning I took the launch out for forty minutes or so to test the engine. She's been giving a bit of trouble. That took from seven-forty-five until twenty past eight, near enough.
0745|quarter to eight|Tony marks papers until quarter to eight. Sunlight floods the room, made golden by the yellow leaves outside; a jet flies over; the garbage truck approaches along the street, clanking like a tank.
0745|Seven-forty-five|Seven-forty-five the black boys move down the line of Chronics taping catheters on the ones that will hold still for it. Catheters are second-hand condoms the ends clipped off and rubber-banded to tubes that run down pantlegs to a plastic sack marked DISPOSABLE NOT TO BE RE-USED, which it is my job to wash out at the end of each day.
0745|fifteen minutes to eight|Contrary to his habit of being late, Pierre on that day arrived at the Bergsâ€™ house, not at ten but at fifteen minutes to eight.
0745|quarter to eight|Mr. Green left for work at a quarter to eight, as he did every morning. He walked down his front steps carrying his empty-looking leatherette briefcase with the noisy silver clasps, opened his car door, and ducked his head to climb into the driver's seat.
