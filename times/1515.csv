1515|quarter after three|A quarter after three. There was time to check with the local morgues to see if they had turned up any likely John Does - who knew, my search might be over before the day's end - and then get bank to deposit my money and fire off a check to my landlord.
1515|three-fifteen|The boss had had something rather more spectacular than a bowel movement; at three-fifteen that day he had done something in his pants that was the equivalent of a shit A-bomb.
1515|three-fifteen|Sixsmith next lines up for an airplane ticket. News of delays lulls him like a litany. He keeps a nervous eye out for sign of Seaboard’s agents coming to pick him up at this late hour. Finally, a ticket clerk waves him over.<br>“I have to get to London. Any destination in the United Kingdom, in fact. Any seat, any airline. I’ll pay in cash.”<br>“Not a 𝘱𝘳𝘢𝘺𝘦𝘳, sir.” The clerk’s tiredness shows through her makeup. “Earliest I can manage”—she consults a teleprinted sheet—"London Heathrow . . .. tomorrow afternoon, three-fifteen departure, Laker Skytrains, change at JFK."
1515|quarter past three|Gordon was alone. He wandered back to the door. The strawberry-nosed man glanced over his shoulder, caught Gordon's eye, and moved off, foiled. He had been on the point of slipping Edgar Wallace into his pocket. The clock over the Prince of Wales struck a quarter past three.
1515|3:15|I got out my old clothes. I put wool socks over my regular socks and took my time lacing up the boots. I made a couple of tuna sandwiches and some double-decker peanut-butter crackers. I filled my canteen and attached the hunting knife and the canteen to my belt. As I was going out the door, I decided to leave a note. So I wrote: "Feeling better and going to Birch Creek. Back soon. R. 3:15." That was about four hours from now.
1515|3:15|July 3: 5 3/4 hours. Little done today. Deepening lethargy, dragged myself over to the lab, nearly left the road twice. Concentrated enough to feed the zoo and get the log up to date. Read through the operating manuals Whitby left for the last time, decided on a delivery rate of 40 röntgens/min., target distance of 530 cm. Everything is ready now. Woke 11:05. To sleep 3:15.
