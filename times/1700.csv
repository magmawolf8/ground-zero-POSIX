1700|five o'clock|The gloomy five o'clock sky was such as you might see on any autumn afternoon. The few houses and the clumps of red or yellowish trees were in no way remarkable. Who could imagine that a little farther on in the quiet landscape I should meet and shake by the hand a man who had lived and eaten and drunk in a world forty million miles distant from London, who had seen this earth from where it looks like a mere point of green fire, and who had spoken with a creature whose life began before our own planet was inhabitable?
1700|five o’clock|“I believe it is customary in good society to take some slight refreshment at five o’clock.”
1700|5 o’clock|“Shall I see you again before my departure?” asked Albert.<br/>“That will be according to the circumstances; when do you set off?”<br/>“Tomorrow evening, at 5 o’clock.”
1700|five|“And what of Irene Adler?” I asked.<br>“Oh, she has turned all the men’s heads down in that part. She is the daintiest thing under a bonnet on this planet. So say the Serpentine-mews, to a man. She lives quietly, sings at concerts, drives out at five every day, and returns at seven sharp for dinner.”
1700|five|Mark was reluctant to go to work, but I said not to worry, I’d be fine. I’d have to be fine eventually and I might as well start now. He said he’d skip out directly after school, get someone else to cover Homework Club; he’d by home by five. It was my day off, which struck me as a bit of a waste, but at least I didn’t have to call Sinead and explain why I wasn’t coming in.
1700|5 p.m.|That evening found him sitting at the mouth of a large storm drain on the slope beneath the Cape Fear Memorial Bridge. He had a room, but there was the small matter of stacked-up back rent, which he had absolutely promised to pay as of 5 p.m. yesterday. Nor was that all. If he returned to his room, he might be invited to visit a certain fortresslike municipal building on Bess Street, to answer certain questions about a certain bar altercation. On the whole, it seemed safer to stay away.
1700|five|My shadow would walk with my on the sand, at least twenty feet long. Hopeful gulls, smelling the croissants in their waxed paper, would circle overhead. And when I walked back, usually around five (although sometimes I stayed later—there was nothing waiting for me in Heaven’s Bay, a town that mostly went sleepybye when summer was over), my shadow walked with me on the water.
1700|five o’clock|Work started as usual on her twentieth birthday, November 17. It had been raining on and off that afternoon, and pouring since early evening.  At five o’clock the manager gathered the employees together to explain the day’s specials. Servers were required to memorize them word for word and not use crib sheets: veal Milanese, pasta topped with sardines and cabbage, chestnut mousse.
1700|five o’clock|“But how did it end?” I interrupt.<br>“That’s just it . . . it didn’t end. I promised to see her Tuesday around five o’clock. That’s bad, you know! There were lines in her face which will look much worse in daylight. I suppose she wants me to f*** her Tuesday.”
1700|five o’clock|With Tania back on the scene, a steady job, the drunken talk about Russia, the walks home at night, and Paris in full summer, life seems to lift its head a little higher. That’s why perhaps, a letter such as Boris sent me seems absolutely cockeyed. Most every day I meet with Tania around five o’clock, to have a Porto with her, as she calls it. I let her take me to places I’ve never seen before, the swell bars around the Champs-Élysées where the sound of jazz and baby voices crooning seems to soak right through the mahogany woodwork.
1700|five|On earth, the clock commanded our lives. I was always aware of the time, and the day of the week, and the month and year. I had made so many plans, mostly with James. "See you at my house at five", I would write him, or "Meet me in the garden tomorrow after school."
1700|five o’clock|Next day at five o’clock she married Tom Buchanan without so much as a shiver, and started off on a three months’ trip to the South Seas.
1700|five|The house was in darkness. I didn’t know what to expect when I pushed open the front door. Ben would be missing me; he had said he would be home by five. I pictured him pacing up and down the living room
1700|five PM|“As part of our effort to discourage drinking and driving, our policy is to courtesy-call people who leave their cars in our lot after closing,” Betsy Neal said. “Your Ford Expedition, Connecticut license plate 775 NSD, will be available for pickup until five PM this evening.”
1700|5:00 P.M.|On this one, the dark background looked like the intersection of Market and Powell at 5:00 P.M., a virtual traffic jam of compressed, energetic spheres. Speedy messengers, all carrying oxygen to parts of someone else’s body.
1700|five o’clock|On the principle that the best hiding place is in plain sight, the core group of conspirators met at five o’clock that  afternoon in Kordt’s office in the Prussian State building: Gisevius and von Schulenburg from the Interior Ministry, Dohnányi from Justice, Colonel Oster of the Abwehr, and Kordt and Hartmann from the Foreign Service.
1700|five o’clock|At five o’clock the two ladies retired to dress, and at half-past six Elizabeth was summoned to dinner.
1700|five o’clock|“I am going to have a bobbing party,” it said, “on Thursday, December the seventeenth, at five o’clock, and I would like it very much if you could come.”
1700|five o’clock|At five o’clock he felt the need of hearing his own voice, so he retreated to his house to see if any one else had arrived. Having climbed the rickety stairs he scrutinized his room resignedly, concluding that it was hopeless to attempt any more inspired decoration than class banners and tiger pictures. There was a tap at the door.
1700|five-o’clock|About three-fourths of the whole business was for effect and therefore harmless, ended at the door of the cafe, soon enough for the five-o’clock train back to Yale or Princeton; about one-fourth continued on into the dimmer hours and gathered strange dust from strange places. Their party was scheduled to be one of the harmless kind.
1700|five o’clock|At five o’clock I was in the Hotel Crillon waiting for Brett. She was not there, so I sat down and wrote some letters.
1700|5.00 p.m.|5.00 p.m. Read a book
1700|five o'clock|At five o'clock that afternoon, while Barbara waited in a taxi, Harold went into the convent in Auteuil and explained to the nun who sat in the concierge's glass cage that Mme. Straus-Muguet was expecting them. He assumed that men were not permitted any further, and that they would all three go out for tea.
1700|five o’clock|At five o’clock adieux were waved, and the ponderous liner edged away from the long pier, slowly turned its nose seaward, discarded its tug, and headed for the widening water spaces that led to old world wonders. By night the outer harbour was cleared, and late passengers watched the stars twinkling above an unpolluted ocean.
1700|five o'clock|But I took the mixture at five o'clock in the afternoon. I run my tongue over my dry mouth. I feel dizzy. I know this dizziness: it's because I haven't had a cigarette for hours.
1700|five o'clock|ERE THE HALF-HOUR ended, five o'clock struck; school was dismissed, and all were gone into the refectory to tea. I now ventured to descend; it was deep dusk; I retired into a corner and sat down on the floor.
1700|five o'clock|From five o'clock to eight is on certain occasions a little eternity; but on such an occasion as this the interval could be only an eternity of pleasure.
1700|five o'clock|He found it harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon and when he left the building at five o'clock, he was still so worried that he walked straight into someone just outside the door.
1700|five o'clock|She had not seen her yet, as Osmond had given her to understand that it was too soon to begin. She drove at five o'clock to a high floor in a narrow street in the quarter of the Piazza Navona, and was admitted by the portress of the convent, a genial and obsequious person. Isabel had been at this institution before; she had come with Pansy to see the sisters.
1700|five o'clock|Until five o'clock there was no sign of life from the room. Then he rang for his servant and ordered a cold bath.
1700|five o'clock|We motored, I remember, leaving London in the morning in a heavy shower of rain, coming to Manderley about five o'clock, in time for tea. I can see myself now, unsuitably dressed as usual, although a bride of seven weeks, in a tan-coloured stockinette frock, a small fur known as a stone marten round my neck, and over all a shapeless mackintosh, far too big for me and dragging to my ankles.
1700|five o'clock|I haven't been to church in over a year.<br/>"Finally worried about your soul?"<br/>"Please," Cork said<br/>"Of course we can talk. When?"<br/>"Tomorrow. Late afternoon maybe. Say five o'clock?"<br/>"Make it six," the priest suggested. "My office."<br/>"I'll be there," Cork promised.
