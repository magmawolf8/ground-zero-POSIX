0000|midnight|Ren said, "If you go to the football field at midnight on Halloween and say his name three times, his ghost is supposed to appear."
0000|midnight|You, Willi, my friend, said Pastor Fritz softly, "you who sit in midnight darkness at midday, is this Jesus Christ a horn of salvation, a light in your darkness?"
0000|midnight|You take a black cat---isn't that it?---that does not have even one white hair (you know this), and you bind his four paws, and then you take him at midnight to a crossroads and you cry out in a loud voice:
0000|midnight|And I was the lion you do not remember who pushed the boat in which you lay, a child near death, so that it came to the shore where a man sat, wakeful at midnight, to receive you.
0000|midnight|If Jill had been more used to adventures, she might have doubted the Owl’s word, but this never occurred to her; and in the exciting idea of a midnight escape she forgot her sleepiness.
0000|midnight|“And almost exactly at midnight, the Count’s patience was rewarded. For in accordance with the instructions he’d written to Richard, every telephone on the first floor of the Metropol began to ring.”
0000|midnight|“Wins Sibby damn it!” Mr. Hubert said. “Wins Sibby! What the hell else are we setting up till midnight arguing about?”
0000|Midnight|Midnight, and there was frost on the fields and patches of black ice on a road notorious for its accidents—there were bunches of dead flowers tied to fence posts and telegraph poles, and torn gaps in hedges, like some kind of failed crop.
0000|midnight|The Place St. Sulpice, so quiet and deserted, where toward midnight there came every night the woman with the busted umbrella and the crazy veil. Every night she slept there on a bench under her torn umbrella, the ribs hanging down, her dress turning green, her bony fingers and the odor of decay oozing from her body; and in the morning I’d be sitting there myself, taking a quiet snooze in the sunshine, cursing the god-damned pigeons gathering up the crumbs everywhere.
0000|midnight|The house is empty, but Eugene sings as if he had for audience all the crowned heads of Europe. The garden door is open and the odor of wet leaves sops in and the rain blends with Eugene’s 𝘢𝘯𝘨𝘰𝘪𝘴𝘴𝘦 and 𝘵𝘳𝘪𝘴𝘵𝘦𝘴𝘴𝘦. At midnight, after the spectators have saturated the hall with perspiration and foul breaths, I return to sleep on a bench. The exit light, swimming in a halo of tobacco smoke, sheds a faint light on the lower corner of the asbestos curtain; I close my eyes every night on an artificial eye ...
0000|midnight|Trevor had on an Andy Warhol costume: blond bobbed wig, thick black glasses, tight striped shirt. My first impression of him was that he was free spirited, clever, funny. That proved to be completely inaccurate. We left the party together and walked around for hours, lied to each other about our happy lives, ate pizza at midnight, took the Staten Island Ferry back and forth and watched the sun rise.
0000|midnight|J. Came to my bed at midnight, and during our athletics, my door was barged. Farcical horror! Thank God J. had locked it on her way in. The doorknob rattled, insistent knocking began. Fear can clear the mind as well as cloud it, and remembering my 𝘋𝘰𝘯 𝘑𝘶𝘢𝘯, I hid J. in a nest of coverlets and sheets in my sagging bed and left the curtain half open to show I had nothing to hide.
0000|midnight|It was an animal thing. A wilderness thing. Nothing about her belonged to her previous self in that moment. Above all her voice. This could have been the high shriek of a hawk, the soul-haunting howl of a wolf, the rasping cry of a red fox at midnight. It could have been any of them, but not the scream of a sixteen-year-old schoolgirl.
0000|midnight|Oliver Dubois rammed a pickup truck through his front door on a sweaty midnight in July, at the tail end of a massive block party. <br>It wasn’t his truck, and the street was closed to traffic, so the vehicle’s emergence out of darkness and slow rumble up Oak Drive scattered neighbors and guests alike into confused groups on candlelit lawns.
0000|Midnight|She looked at the digital display of her watch.<br>00:00:00<br>Midnight, as the clock had told her.<br>She waited for the next second to arrive, but it didn’t.
0000|midnight|Farewell, sweet playfellow: pray thou for us;<br>And good luck grant thee thy Demetrius!-<br>Keep word, Lysander: we must starve our sight<br>From lovers’ food till morrow deep midnight.
0000|midnight|Here before me was a vast sweep of empty space: just the closed door and me, and only the stars sprinkled across the midnight sky to see what I did next. Did those cold, distant lights watch with any vestige of the humans they had once been, those special, chosen, favored ones who had brushed to close to the divine?
0000|midnight|Had the lure of blood and ecstasy in the midnight woods brought her sailing over the glittering blue waters? I wondered why she was here now, in the vineyard.
0000|midnight|She summoned the police and, when the men came, sympathetic, at midnight, she gave testimony. To have given a home to the wolf and succour to the rabid dog.
0000|midnight|One Christmas at midnight on the button, at the old place, the ward door blows open with a crash, in comes a fat man with a beard, eyes ringed red by the cold and his nose just the color of a cherry.
0000|midnight|At midnight, the lights in the café’s kitchen could be particularly harsh. Without the comfort of the daylight streaming in through the stained-glass window, everything in the room looked grim and utilitarian.
0000|midnight|Sometimes there is no darker place than our own thoughts; the moonless midnight of the mind.
0000|midnight|“It starts at midnight.”
0000|midnight|Dawn seemed to follow midnight with indecent haste.
0000|twelve o’clock|“I shall never forget his flying Henry’s kite for him that very windy day last Easter—and ever since his particular kindness last September twelvemonth in writing that note, at twelve o’clock at night, on purpose to assure me that there was no scarlet fever at Cobham, I have been convinced there could not be a more feeling heart nor a better man in existence.—If any body can deserve him, it must be Miss Taylor.”
0000|twelve o’clock|On the night after his ride to Lawrenceville a crowd sallied to New York in quest of adventure, and started back to Princeton about twelve o’clock in two machines. It had been a gay party and different stages of sobriety were represented.
0000|midnight|As midnight was striking bronze blows upon the dusky air, Dorian Gray, dressed commonly, and with a muffler wrapped round his throat, crept quietly out of his house.
0000|midnight|But wait till I tell you, he said. "We had a midnight lunch too after all the jollification and when we sallied forth it was blue o'clock the morning after the night before." 
0000|midnight|Midnight, you said. What is midnight to the young? And suddenly a festive blaze was flung Across five cedar trunks, snow patches showed, And a patrol car on our bumpy road Came to a crunching stop. Retake, retake!
0000|12.00|That a man who could hardly see anything more than two feet away from him could be employed as a security guard suggested to me that our job was not to secure anything but to report for work every night, fill the bulky ledger with cryptic remarks like 'Patrolled perimeter 12.00 pm, No Incident' and go to the office every fortnight for our wages and listen to the talkative Ms Elgassier.
0000|midnight|'Tis the year's midnight, and it is the day's, Lucy's, who scarce seven hours herself unmasks; The sun is spent, and now his flasks Send forth light squibs, no constant rays;
0000|midnight|At midnight his wife and daughter might still be bustling about, preparing holiday delicacies in the kitchen, straightening up the house, or perhaps getting their kimonos ready or arranging flowers. Oki would sit in the living room and listen to the radio. As the bells rang he would look back at the departing year. He always found it a moving experience.
0000|twelve|Bernardo: 'Tis now struck twelve; get thee to bed, Francisco.
0000|midnight|But, odder still - Big Ben had once again struck midnight. The time outside still corresponded to that registered by the stopped gilt clock, inside. Inside and outside matched exactly, but both were badly wrong. H'm.
0000|midnight|But in the end I understood this language. I understood it, I understood it, all wrong perhaps. That is not what matters. It told me to write the report. Does this mean I am freer now than I was? I do not know. I shall learn. Then I went back into the house and wrote, It is midnight. The rain is beating on the windows. It was not midnight. It was not raining.

0000|twelve|Hamlet: What hour now? Horatio: I think it lacks of twelve. Marcellus: No, it is struck.
0000|midnight|He is certain he heard footsteps: they come nearer, and then die away. The ray of light beneath his door is extinguished. It is midnight; some one has turned out the gas; the last servant has gone to bed, and he must lie all night in agony with no one to bring him any help.
0000|midnight|I am conceived to the chimes of midnight on the clock on the mantelpiece in the room across the hall. The clock once belonged to my great-grandmother (a woman called Alice) and its tired chime counts me into the world.
0000|twelve|I took her hand in mine, and bid her be composed; for a succession of shudders convulsed her frame, and she would keep straining her gaze towards the glass. 'There's nobody here!' I insisted. 'It was YOURSELF, Mrs. Linton: you knew it a while since.' 'Myself!' she gasped, 'and the clock is striking twelve! It's true, then! that's dreadful!'
0000|midnight|I was born in the city of Bombay . . . On the stroke of midnight, as a matter of fact. Clock-hands joined palms in respectful greeting as I came. Oh, spell it out, spell it out: at the precise instant of India's arrival at independence, I tumbled forth into the world.
0000|midnight|It is midnight. The rain is beating on the windows. I am calm. All is sleeping. Nevertheless I get up and go to my desk. I can't sleep.
0000|midnight|Midnight had come upon the crowded city. The palace, the night-cellar, the jail, the madhouse; the chambers of birth and death, of health and sickness; the rigid face of the corpse and the calm sleep of the child - midnight was upon them all.
0000|midnight|Once upon a midnight dreary,<br/>while I pondered weak and weary,<br/>Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore,<br/>While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,<br/>As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.<br/>"Tis some visitor," I muttered, "tapping at my chamber door - Only this, and nothing more."

0000|twelve o'clock|To begin my life with the beginning of my life, I record that I was born (as I have been informed an believe) on a Friday, at twelve o'clock at night. It was remarked that the clock began to strike, and I began to cry, simultaneously.
0000|midnight|We have heard the chimes at midnight.
0000|midnight|It was surely midnight by now. A lone bird called, and the individual trees melted together in one forbidding and unfriendly mass.

Somewhere in this deep forest lay this demented man he was supposed to try to comfort and calm.
0000|midnight|There was the midnight hike with the boys to the end of the promenade and the big argument about the election of a housemaster. What had become of responsibility and service? And brotherly love?
