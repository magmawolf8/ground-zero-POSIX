1830|SIX-THIRTY|SIX-THIRTY ON REACHER’S watch, the motion inside the truck changed. Six hours and four minutes they’d cruised steadily, maybe fifty-five or sixty miles an hour, while the heat peaked and fell away. He’d sat, hot and rocking and bouncing in the dark with the wheel well between him and Holly Johnson, ticking off the distance against a map inside his head.

"Well," he said, once more across the gap, "say tomorrow's no good, I'm going to Norwich, but Friday at half-past six, same as usual."
1830|half past six|At five o'clock the two ladies retired to dress, and at half past six Elizabeth was summoned to dinner.
1830|six thirty|It is six thirty. Now the dark night and the deafening racket of the crickets again engulf the garden and the veranda, all around the house
1830|half-past six|To a casual visitor it might have seemed that Mr. Penicuik, who owned the house, had fallen upon evil days; but two of the three gentlemen assembled in the Saloon at half-past six on a wintry evening of late February were in no danger of falling into this error.
