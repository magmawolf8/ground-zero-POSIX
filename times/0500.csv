0500|five in the morning|“I just took all the pills in the bathroom cabinet,” she says. “Sixty-two aspirin with codeine, twenty-four Valiums.

0500|5:00 A.M.|Soft yellow light came through the side windows. It was morning: he had slept the whole night! He looked quickly at his watch: 5:00 A.M. Still almost six hours to go before the boat had to be recalled.

0500|five o’clock|THE HAMMER BANGED reveille on the rail outside camp HQ at five o’clock as always. Time to get up. The ragged noise was muffled by ice two fingers thick on the windows and soon died away. Too cold for the warder to go on hammering.
0500|five o’clock in the morning|According to Leon … the day after tomorrow. The attack is scheduled for the day after tomorrow at about five o’clock in the morning. His face was still in shadow.

0500|five|Thursday morning. The day of. Billy gets up at five. He eats toast with a glass of water to wash it down. No coffee. No caffeine of any kind until the job is done. When he shoulders the 700 and looks through the Leupold scope, he wants his hands perfectly steady.

I could tell my sense of balance was off—I nearly fell over when I tried to stand up, but I pushed through it and tidied up for a while, sliding the videocassettes into their cases and putting them back on the shelf. I thought some activity might tire me out. I took a Zyprexa and some more Ativan. I ate a handful of melatonin, chewing like a cow on cud.

0500|5 a.m.|Soon after 5 a.m. he noticed the sky at its edges beginning to turn an oyster grey. Gradually the dark crests of the wooded pine hills emerged, serrated like a saw’s teeth against the spreading light, while in the valleys the white mist seemed as solid as a glacier.
